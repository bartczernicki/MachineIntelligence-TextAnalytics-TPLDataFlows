GORDON PYM  INTRODUCTORY NOTE        Upon my return to the United States a few months ago, after the       extraordinary series of adventure in the South Seas and       elsewhere, of which an account is given in the following pages,       accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in       Richmond, Va., who felt deep interest in all matters relating to       the regions I had visited, and who were constantly urging it upon       me, as a duty, to give my narrative to the public. I had several       reasons, however, for declining to do so, some of which were of a       nature altogether private, and concern no person but myself;       others not so much so. One consideration which deterred me was       that, having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time       in which I was absent, I feared I should not be able to write,       from mere memory, a statement so minute and connected as to have       the _appearance_of that truth it would really possess, barring       only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us       are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence       in exciting the imaginative faculties. Another reason was, that       the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively       marvellous that, unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be       (except by the evidence of a single individual, and he a       half-breed Indian), I could only hope for belief among my family,       and those of my friends who have had reason, through life, to put       faith in my veracity—the probability being that the public at       large would regard what I should put forth as merely an impudent       and ingenious fiction. A distrust in my own abilities as a writer       was, nevertheless, one of the principal causes which prevented me       from complying with the suggestions of my advisers.        Among those gentlemen in Virginia who expressed the greatest       interest in my statement, more particularly in regard to that       portion of it which related to the Antarctic Ocean, was Mr. Poe,       lately editor of the “Southern Literary Messenger,” a monthly       magazine, published by Mr. Thomas W. White, in the city of       Richmond. He strongly advised me, among others, to prepare at       once a full account of what I had seen and undergone, and trust       to the shrewdness and common-sense of the public—insisting, with       great plausibility, that however roughly, as regards mere       authorship, my book should be got up, its very uncouthness, if       there were any, would give it all the better chance of being       received as truth.        Notwithstanding this representation, I did not make up my mind to       do as he suggested. He afterward proposed (finding that I would       not stir in the matter) that I should allow him to draw up, in       his own words, a narrative of the earlier portion of my       adventures, from facts afforded by myself, publishing it in the       “Southern Messenger” _under the garb of fiction. _To this,       perceiving no objection, I consented, stipulating only that my       real name should be retained. Two numbers of the pretended       fiction appeared, consequently, in the “Messenger” for January       and February (1837), and, in order that it might certainly be       regarded as fiction, the name of Mr. Poe was affixed to the       articles in the table of contents of the magazine.        The manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at       length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the       adventures in question; for I found that, in spite of the air of       fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of       my statement which appeared in the “Messenger” (without altering       or distorting a single fact), the public were still not at all       disposed to receive it as fable, and several letters were sent to       Mr. P.’s address, distinctly expressing a conviction to the       contrary. I thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would       prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence       of their own authenticity, and that I had consequently little to       fear on the score of popular incredulity.        This _exposé_being made, it will be seen at once how much of what       follows I claim to be my own writing; and it will also be       understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages       which were written by Mr. Poe. Even to those readers who have not       seen the “Messenger,” it will be unnecessary to point out where       his portion ends and my own commences; the difference in point of       style will be readily perceived.  A. G. PYM.     CHAPTER 1         My name is Arthur Gordon Pym. My father was a respectable trader       in sea-stores at Nantucket, where I was born. My maternal       grandfather was an attorney in good practice. He was fortunate in       every thing, and had speculated very successfully in stocks of       the Edgarton New Bank, as it was formerly called. By these and       other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money. He       was more attached to myself, I believe, than to any other person       in the world, and I expected to inherit the most of his property       at his death. He sent me, at six years of age, to the school of       old Mr. Ricketts, a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric       manners—he is well known to almost every person who has visited       New Bedford. I stayed at his school until I was sixteen, when I       left him for Mr. E. Ronald’s academy on the hill. Here I became       intimate with the son of Mr. Barnard, a sea-captain, who       generally sailed in the employ of Lloyd and Vredenburgh—Mr.       Barnard is also very well known in New Bedford, and has many       relations, I am certain, in Edgarton. His son was named Augustus,       and he was nearly two years older than myself. He had been on a       whaling voyage with his father in the John Donaldson, and was       always talking to me of his adventures in the South Pacific       Ocean. I used frequently to go home with him, and remain all day,       and sometimes all night. We occupied the same bed, and he would       be sure to keep me awake until almost light, telling me stories       of the natives of the Island of Tinian, and other places he had       visited in his travels. At last I could not help being interested       in what he said, and by degrees I felt the greatest desire to go       to sea. I owned a sailboat called the Ariel, and worth about       seventy-five dollars. She had a half-deck or cuddy, and was       rigged sloop-fashion—I forget her tonnage, but she would hold ten       persons without much crowding. In this boat we were in the habit       of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world; and, when I       now think of them, it appears to me a thousand wonders that I am       alive to-day.        I will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a       longer and more momentous narrative. One night there was a party       at Mr. Barnard’s, and both Augustus and myself were not a little       intoxicated toward the close of it. As usual, in such cases, I       took part of his bed in preference to going home. He went to       sleep, as I thought, very quietly (it being near one when the       party broke up), and without saying a word on his favorite topic.       It might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in       bed, and I was just about falling into a doze, when he suddenly       started up, and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go       to sleep for any Arthur Pym in Christendom, when there was so       glorious a breeze from the southwest. I never was so astonished       in my life, not knowing what he intended, and thinking that the       wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside       himself. He proceeded to talk very coolly, however, saying he       knew that I supposed him intoxicated, but that he was never more       sober in his life. He was only tired, he added, of lying in bed       on such a fine night like a dog, and was determined to get up and       dress, and go out on a frolic with the boat. I can hardly tell       what possessed me, but the words were no sooner out of his mouth       than I felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure, and       thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most       reasonable things in the world. It was blowing almost a gale, and       the weather was very cold—it being late in October. I sprang out       of bed, nevertheless, in a kind of ecstasy, and told him I was       quite as brave as himself, and quite as tired as he was of lying       in bed like a dog, and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as       any Augustus Barnard in Nantucket.        We lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to       the boat. She was lying at the old decayed wharf by the       lumber-yard of Pankey & Co., and almost thumping her side out       against the rough logs. Augustus got into her and bailed her, for       she was nearly half full of water. This being done, we hoisted       jib and mainsail, kept full, and started boldly out to sea.        The wind, as I before said, blew freshly from the southwest. The       night was very clear and cold. Augustus had taken the helm, and I       stationed myself by the mast, on the deck of the cuddy. We flew       along at a great rate—neither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf. I now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer, and what time he thought it probable       we should get back. He whistled for a few minutes, and then said       crustily: “_I_ am going to sea—_you_ may go home if you think       proper.” Turning my eyes upon him, I perceived at once that, in       spite of his assumed _nonchalance_, he was greatly agitated. I       could see him distinctly by the light of the moon—his face was       paler than any marble, and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller. I found that something       had gone wrong, and became seriously alarmed. At this period I       knew little about the management of a boat, and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend. The wind, too, had       suddenly increased, as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       land—still I was ashamed to betray any trepidation, and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence. I could stand       it no longer, however, and spoke to Augustus about the propriety       of turning back. As before, it was nearly a minute before he made       answer, or took any notice of my suggestion. “By-and-by,” said he       at length—“time enough—home by-and-by.” I had expected a similar       reply, but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread. I again looked       at the speaker attentively. His lips were perfectly livid, and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand. “For God’s sake, Augustus,” I screamed, now       heartily frightened, “what ails you?—what is the matter?—what       _are_ you going to do?” “Matter!” he stammered, in the greatest       apparent surprise, letting go the tiller at the same moment, and       falling forward into the bottom of the boat—“matter—why, nothing       is the—matter—going home—d—d—don’t you see?” The whole truth now       flashed upon me. I flew to him and raised him up. He was       drunk—beastly drunk—he could no longer either stand, speak, or       see. His eyes were perfectly glazed; and as I let him go in the       extremity of my despair, he rolled like a mere log into the       bilge-water, from which I had lifted him. It was evident that,       during the evening, he had drunk far more than I suspected, and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highly-concentrated state of intoxication—a state which, like       madness, frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses. The       coolness of the night air, however, had had its usual effect—the       mental energy began to yield before its influence—and the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe. He was now       thoroughly insensible, and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours.        It is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror. The       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated, leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute. I knew that I was altogether incapable of       managing the boat, and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction. A storm was evidently gathering       behind us; we had neither compass nor provisions; and it was       clear that, if we held our present course, we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak. These thoughts, with a crowd of       others equally fearful, flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity, and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion. The boat was going       through the water at a terrible rate—full before the wind—no reef       in either jib or mainsail—running her bows completely under the       foam. It was a thousand wonders she did not broach to—Augustus       having let go the tiller, as I said before, and I being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself. By good luck, however, she       kept steady, and gradually I recovered some degree of presence of       mind. Still the wind was increasing fearfully, and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward, the sea behind fell combing over our       counter, and deluged us with water. I was so utterly benumbed,       too, in every limb, as to be nearly unconscious of sensation. At       length I summoned up the resolution of despair, and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run. As might have been expected,       it flew over the bows, and, getting drenched with water, carried       away the mast short off by the board. This latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction. Under the jib only, I now       boomed along before the wind, shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter, but relieved from the terror of immediate       death. I took the helm, and breathed with greater freedom as I       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape.       Augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat; and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning (the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell), I contrived to raise him       partially up, and keep him in a sitting position, by passing a       rope round his waist, and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy. Having thus arranged every thing as well as I could in       my chilled and agitated condition, I recommended myself to God,       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power.        Hardly had I come to this resolution, when, suddenly, a loud and       long scream or yell, as if from the throats of a thousand demons,       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat.       Never while I live shall I forget the intense agony of terror I       experienced at that moment. My hair stood erect on my head—I felt       the blood congealing in my veins—my heart ceased utterly to beat,       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm, I tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion.        I found myself, upon reviving, in the cabin of a large       whaling-ship (the Penguin) bound to Nantucket. Several persons       were standing over me, and Augustus, paler than death, was busily       occupied in chafing my hands. Upon seeing me open my eyes, his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the rough-looking personages who were present. The       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained. We had       been run down by the whaling-ship, which was close-hauled,       beating up to Nantucket with every sail she could venture to set,       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course. Several men were on the look-out forward, but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contact—their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me. The huge ship, I was told, rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather, and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress. Not a scream arose from the deck of       the victim—there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water, as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyer—but this was all. Thinking our boat (which it will be       remembered was dismasted) some mere shell cut adrift as useless,       the captain (Captain E. T. V. Block, of New London) was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter. Luckily, there were two of the look-out who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm, and       represented the possibility of yet saving him. A discussion       ensued, when Block grew angry, and, after a while, said that “it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for egg-shells;       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense; and if       there was a man run down, it was nobody’s fault but his own, he       might drown and be dammed” or some language to that effect.       Henderson, the first mate, now took the matter up, being justly       indignant, as well as the whole ship’s crew, at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity. He spoke plainly, seeing       himself upheld by the men, told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows, and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore. He       strode aft, jostling Block (who turned pale and made no answer)       on one side, and seizing the helm, gave the word, in a firm       voice, Hard-a-lee! The men flew to their posts, and the ship went       cleverly about. All this had occupied nearly five minutes, and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be saved—allowing any to have been on board       the boat. Yet, as the reader has seen, both Augustus and myself       were rescued; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of Providence.        While the ship was yet in stays, the mate lowered the jolly-boat       and jumped into her with the very two men, I believe, who spoke       up as having seen me at the helm. They had just left the lee of       the vessel (the moon still shining brightly) when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward, and Henderson, at the same moment,       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water. He       would say nothing else—repeating his cry impatiently, back water!       back water! The men put back as speedily as possible, but by this       time the ship had gone round, and gotten fully under headway,       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail. In despite of the danger of the attempt, the mate clung       to the main-chains as soon as they came within his reach. Another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel, when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough. The body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom (the Penguin was coppered and copper-fastened), and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull.       After several ineffectual efforts, made during the lurches of the       ship, and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat I was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board—for the       body proved to be my own. It appeared that one of the       timber-bolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper, it had arrested my progress as I passed under the ship,       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom. The       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket I had on, and through the back part of my neck,       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear. I was immediately put to bed—although life seemed to be       totally extinct. There was no surgeon on board. The captain,       however, treated me with every attention—to make amends, I       presume, in the eyes of his crew, for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure.        In the meantime, Henderson had again put off from the ship,       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane. He had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat, and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest. This induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour, although repeated       signals to return were made them by Captain Block, and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril. Indeed, it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant. She was built,       however, for the whaling service, and was fitted, as I have since       had reason to believe, with air-boxes, in the manner of some       life-boats used on the coast of Wales.        After searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned, it was determined to get back to the ship. They had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by. They pursued and soon overtook       it. It proved to be the entire deck of the Ariel’s cuddy.       Augustus was struggling near it, apparently in the last agonies.       Upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber. This rope, it will be remembered, I       had myself tied around his waist, and made fast to a ringbolt,       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position, and my so       doing, it appeared, had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life. The Ariel was slightly put together, and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces; the deck of the cuddy, as       might have been expected, was lifted, by the force of the water       rushing in, entirely from the main timbers, and floated (with       other fragments, no doubt) to the surface—Augustus was buoyed up       with it, and thus escaped a terrible death.        It was more than an hour after being taken on board the Penguin       before he could give any account of himself, or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat. At length he became thoroughly aroused, and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water. Upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness, he found himself beneath the surface,       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity, and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck. In an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward, when, his       head striking violently against a hard substance, he again       relapsed into insensibility. Upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reason—this was still, however, in the       greatest degree clouded and confused. He now knew that some       accident had occurred, and that he was in the water, although his       mouth was above the surface, and he could breathe with some       freedom. Possibly, at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind, and drawing him after it, as he floated upon his       back. Of course, as long as he could have retained this position,       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned.       Presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck, and this       post he endeavored to maintain, screaming at intervals for help.       Just before he was discovered by Mr. Henderson, he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion, and, falling into       the sea, had given himself up for lost. During the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       Ariel, nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster. A vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties. When he was finally picked up, every       power of his mind had failed him; and, as before said, it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the Penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition. In regard to myself—I was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death (and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half) by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oil—a proceeding suggested by Augustus. The wound in my neck,       although of an ugly appearance, proved of little real       consequence, and I soon recovered from its effects.        The Penguin got into port about nine o’clock in the morning,       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       Nantucket. Both Augustus and myself managed to appear at Mr.       Barnard’s in time for breakfast—which, luckily, was somewhat       late, owing to the party over night. I suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearance—of course, it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny. Schoolboys, however, can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception, and I verily believe not one of our friends in       Nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils, had reference       either to the Ariel, my companion, or myself. We two have since       very frequently talked the matter over—but never without a       shudder. In one of our conversations Augustus frankly confessed       to me, that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay, as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication, and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence.     CHAPTER 2         In no affairs of mere prejudice, pro or con, do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty, even from the most simple data.       It might be supposed that a catastrophe such as I have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea. On the contrary, I never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance.       This short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows, and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color, all the picturesqueness, of       the late perilous accident. My conversations with Augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest. He had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean (more than one half       of which I now suspect to have been sheer fabrications) well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination. It is strange,       too, that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman, when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair. For the bright side of the painting I had       a limited sympathy. My visions were of shipwreck and famine; of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes; of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears, upon some gray and desolate rock, in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown. Such visions or desires—for       they amounted to desires—are common, I have since been assured,       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men—at the       time of which I speak I regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which I felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil.       Augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind. It is       probable, indeed, that our intimate communion had resulted in a       partial interchange of character.        About eighteen months after the period of the Ariel’s disaster,       the firm of Lloyd and Vredenburgh (a house connected in some       manner with the Messieurs Enderby, I believe, of Liverpool) were       engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig Grampus for a       whaling voyage. She was an old hulk, and scarcely seaworthy when       all was done to her that could be done. I hardly know why she was       chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same       owners—but so it was. Mr. Barnard was appointed to command her,       and Augustus was going with him. While the brig was getting       ready, he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the       opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel. He       found me by no means an unwilling listener—yet the matter could       not be so easily arranged. My father made no direct opposition;       but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the       design; and, more than all, my grandfather, from whom I expected       much, vowed to cut me off with a shilling if I should ever broach       the subject to him again. These difficulties, however, so far       from abating my desire, only added fuel to the flame. I       determined to go at all hazards; and, having made known my       intentions to Augustus, we set about arranging a plan by which it       might be accomplished. In the meantime I forbore speaking to any       of my relations in regard to the voyage, and, as I busied myself       ostensibly with my usual studies, it was supposed that I had       abandoned the design. I have since frequently examined my conduct       on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of       surprise. The intense hypocrisy I made use of for the furtherance       of my project—an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my       life for so long a period of time—could only have been rendered       tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with       which I looked forward to the fulfilment of my long-cherished       visions of travel.        In pursuance of my scheme of deception, I was necessarily obliged       to leave much to the management of Augustus, who was employed for       the greater part of every day on board the Grampus, attending to       some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold. At       night, however, we were sure to have a conference and talk over       our hopes. After nearly a month passed in this manner, without       our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed, he told       me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary. I       had a relation living in New Bedford, a Mr. Ross, at whose house       I was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at       a time. The brig was to sail about the middle of June (June,       1827), and it was agreed that, a day or two before her putting to       sea, my father was to receive a note, as usual, from Mr. Ross,       asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with Robert and       Emmet (his sons). Augustus charged himself with the inditing of       this note and getting it delivered. Having set out as supposed,       for New Bedford, I was then to report myself to my companion, who       would contrive a hiding-place for me in the Grampus. This       hiding-place, he assured me, would be rendered sufficiently       comfortable for a residence of many days, during which I was not       to make my appearance. When the brig had proceeded so far on her       course as to make any turning back a matter out of question, I       should then, he said, be formally installed in all the comforts       of the cabin; and as to his father, he would only laugh heartily       at the joke. Vessels enough would be met with by which a letter       might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents.        The middle of June at length arrived, and every thing had been       matured. The note was written and delivered, and on a Monday       morning I left the house for the New Bedford packet, as supposed.       I went, however, straight to Augustus, who was waiting for me at       the corner of a street. It had been our original plan that I       should keep out of the way until dark, and then slip on board the       brig; but, as there was now a thick fog in our favor, it was       agreed to lose no time in secreting me. Augustus led the way to       the wharf, and I followed at a little distance, enveloped in a       thick seaman’s cloak, which he had brought with him, so that my       person might not be easily recognized. Just as we turned the       second corner, after passing Mr. Edmund’s well, who should       appear, standing right in front of me, and looking me full in the       face, but old Mr. Peterson, my grandfather. “Why, bless my soul,       Gordon,” said he, after a long pause, “why, why,—whose dirty       cloak is that you have on?” “Sir!” I replied, assuming, as well       as I could, in the exigency of the moment, an air of offended       surprise, and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable       tones—“sir! you are a sum’mat mistaken—my name, in the first       place, bee’nt nothing at all like Goddin, and I’d want you for to       know better, you blackguard, than to call my new obercoat a darty       one.” For my life I could hardly refrain from screaming with       laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received       this handsome rebuke. He started back two or three steps, turned       first pale and then excessively red, threw up his spectacles,       then, putting them down, ran full tilt at me, with his umbrella       uplifted. He stopped short, however, in his career, as if struck       with a sudden recollection; and presently, turning round, hobbled       off down the street, shaking all the while with rage, and       muttering between his teeth: “Won’t do—new glasses—thought it was       Gordon—d—d good-for-nothing salt water Long Tom.”        After this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution, and       arrived at our point of destination in safety. There were only       one or two of the hands on board, and these were busy forward,       doing something to the forecastle combings. Captain Barnard, we       knew very well, was engaged at Lloyd and Vredenburgh’s, and would       remain there until late in the evening, so we had little to       apprehend on his account. Augustus went first up the vessel’s       side, and in a short while I followed him, without being noticed       by the men at work. We proceeded at once into the cabin, and       found no person there. It was fitted up in the most comfortable       style—a thing somewhat unusual in a whaling-vessel. There were       four very excellent staterooms, with wide and convenient berths.       There was also a large stove, I took notice, and a remarkably       thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin       and staterooms. The ceiling was full seven feet high, and, in       short, every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature       than I had anticipated. Augustus, however, would allow me but       little time for observation, insisting upon the necessity of my       concealing myself as soon as possible. He led the way into his       own stateroom, which was on the starboard side of the brig, and       next to the bulkheads. Upon entering, he closed the door and       bolted it. I thought I had never seen a nicer little room than       the one in which I now found myself. It was about ten feet long,       and had only one berth, which, as I said before, was wide and       convenient. In that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads       there was a space of four feet square, containing a table, a       chair, and a set of hanging shelves full of books, chiefly books       of voyages and travels. There were many other little comforts in       the room, among which I ought not to forget a kind of safe or       refrigerator, in which Augustus pointed out to me a host of       delicacies, both in the eating and drinking department.        He now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the       carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned, letting me know       that a portion of the flooring, about sixteen inches square, had       been neatly cut out and again adjusted. As he pressed, this       portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of       his finger beneath. In this manner he raised the mouth of the       trap (to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks), and I       found that it led into the after hold. He next lit a small taper       by means of a phosphorous match, and, placing the light in a dark       lantern, descended with it through the opening, bidding me       follow. I did so, and he then pulled the cover upon the hole, by       means of a nail driven into the under side—the carpet, of course,       resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom, and       all traces of the aperture being concealed.        The taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest       difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of       lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my       eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with less       trouble, holding on to the skirts of my friend’s coat. He brought       me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable       narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes       for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and       full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on       the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw       matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every       other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up       to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of       ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates,       hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less       than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the       box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the       stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough       concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man       not going out in the brig.        My companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could       be removed at pleasure. He slipped it aside and displayed the       interior, at which I was excessively amused. A mattress from one       of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom, and it       contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be       crowded into so small a space, allowing me, at the same time,       sufficient room for my accommodation, either in a sitting       position or lying at full length. Among other things, there were       some books, pen, ink, and paper, three blankets, a large jug full       of water, a keg of sea-biscuit, three or four immense Bologna       sausages, an enormous ham, a cold leg of roast mutton, and half a       dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs. I proceeded immediately       to take possession of my little apartment, and this with feelings       of higher satisfaction, I am sure, than any monarch ever       experienced upon entering a new palace. Augustus now pointed out       to me the method of fastening the open end of the box, and then,       holding the taper close to the deck, showed me a piece of dark       whipcord lying along it. This, he said, extended from my       hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the       lumber, to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold,       immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom. By       means of this cord I should be enabled readily to trace my way       out without his guidance, provided any unlooked-for accident       should render such a step necessary. He now took his departure,       leaving with me the lantern, together with a copious supply of       tapers and phosphorous, and promising to pay me a visit as often       as he could contrive to do so without observation. This was on       the seventeenth of June.        I remained three days and nights (as nearly as I could guess) in       my hiding-place without getting out of it at all, except twice       for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between       two crates just opposite the opening. During the whole period I       saw nothing of Augustus; but this occasioned me little       uneasiness, as I knew the brig was expected to put to sea every       hour, and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of       coming down to me. At length I heard the trap open and shut, and       presently he called in a low voice, asking if all was well, and       if there was any thing I wanted. “Nothing,” I replied; “I am as       comfortable as can be; when will the brig sail?” “She will be       under weigh in less than half an hour,” he answered. “I came to       let you know, and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence. I       shall not have a chance of coming down again for some       time—perhaps for three or four days more. All is going on right       aboveboard. After I go up and close the trap, do you creep along       by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in. You will find my       watch there—it may be useful to you, as you have no daylight to       keep time by. I suppose you can’t tell how long you have been       buried—only three days—this is the twentieth. I would bring the       watch to your box, but am afraid of being missed.” With this he       went up.        In about an hour after he had gone I distinctly felt the brig in       motion, and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly       commenced a voyage. Satisfied with this idea, I determined to       make my mind as easy as possible, and await the course of events       until I should be permitted to exchange the box for the more       roomy, although hardly more comfortable, accommodations of the       cabin. My first care was to get the watch. Leaving the taper       burning, I groped along in the dark, following the cord through       windings innumerable, in some of which I discovered that, after       toiling a long distance, I was brought back within a foot or two       of a former position. At length I reached the nail, and securing       the object of my journey, returned with it in safety. I now       looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided,       and selected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of       the Columbia. With this I amused myself for some time, when,       growing sleepy, I extinguished the light with great care, and       soon fell into a sound slumber.        Upon awakening I felt strangely confused in mind, and some time       elapsed before I could bring to recollection all the various       circumstances of my situation. By degrees, however, I remembered       all. Striking a light, I looked at the watch; but it was run       down, and there were, consequently, no means of determining how       long I slept. My limbs were greatly cramped, and I was forced to       relieve them by standing between the crates. Presently feeling an       almost ravenous appetite, I bethought myself of the cold mutton,       some of which I had eaten just before going to sleep, and found       excellent. What was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a       state of absolute putrefaction! This circumstance occasioned me       great disquietude; for, connecting it with the disorder of mind I       experienced upon awakening, I began to suppose that I must have       slept for an inordinately long period of time. The close       atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this,       and might, in the end, be productive of the most serious results.       My head ached excessively; I fancied that I drew every breath       with difficulty; and, in short, I was oppressed with a multitude       of gloomy feelings. Still I could not venture to make any       disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise, and, having wound       up the watch, contented myself as well as possible.        Throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no       person came to my relief, and I could not help accusing Augustus       of the grossest inattention. What alarmed me chiefly was, that       the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint, and I was       suffering much from thirst, having eaten freely of the Bologna       sausages after the loss of my mutton. I became very uneasy, and       could no longer take any interest in my books. I was overpowered,       too, with a desire to sleep, yet trembled at the thought of       indulging it, lest there might exist some pernicious influence,       like that of burning charcoal, in the confined air of the hold.       In the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in       the main ocean, and a dull humming sound, which reached my ears       as if from an immense distance, convinced me no ordinary gale was       blowing. I could not imagine a reason for the absence of       Augustus. We were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to       allow of my going up. Some accident might have happened to       him—but I could think of none which would account for his       suffering me to remain so long a prisoner, except, indeed, his       having suddenly died or fallen overboard, and upon this idea I       could not dwell with any degree of patience. It was possible that       we had been baffled by head winds, and were still in the near       vicinity of Nantucket. This notion, however, I was forced to       abandon; for such being the case, the brig must have frequently       gone about; and I was entirely satisfied, from her continual       inclination to the larboard, that she had been sailing all along       with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter. Besides, granting       that we were still in the neighborhood of the island, why should       not Augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance?       Pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and       cheerless condition, I resolved to wait yet another twenty-four       hours, when, if no relief were obtained, I would make my way to       the trap, and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend,       or get at least a little fresh air through the opening, and a       further supply of water from the stateroom. While occupied with       this thought, however, I fell in spite of every exertion to the       contrary, into a state of profound sleep, or rather stupor. My       dreams were of the most terrific description. Every species of       calamity and horror befell me. Among other miseries I was       smothered to death between huge pillows, by demons of the most       ghastly and ferocious aspect. Immense serpents held me in their       embrace, and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully       shining eyes. Then deserts, limitless, and of the most forlorn       and awe-inspiring character, spread themselves out before me.       Immensely tall trunks of trees, gray and leafless, rose up in       endless succession as far as the eye could reach. Their roots       were concealed in wide-spreading morasses, whose dreary water lay       intensely black, still, and altogether terrible, beneath. And the       strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality, and waving to       and fro their skeleton arms, were crying to the silent waters for       mercy, in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony       and despair. The scene changed; and I stood, naked and alone,       amidst the burning sand-plains of Sahara. At my feet lay crouched       a fierce lion of the tropics. Suddenly his wild eyes opened and       fell upon me. With a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet, and       laid bare his horrible teeth. In another instant there burst from       his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament, and I       fell impetuously to the earth. Stifling in a paroxysm of terror,       I at last found myself partially awake. My dream, then, was not       all a dream. Now, at least, I was in possession of my senses. The       paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my       bosom—his hot breath was in my ear—and his white and ghastly       fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom.        Had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the       utterance of a syllable, I could have neither stirred nor spoken.       The beast, whatever it was, retained his position without       attempting any immediate violence, while I lay in an utterly       helpless, and, I fancied, a dying condition beneath him. I felt       that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me—in a word,       that I was perishing, and perishing of sheer fright. My brain       swam—I grew deadly sick—my vision failed—even the glaring       eyeballs above me grew dim. Making a last strong effort, I at       length breathed a faint ejaculation to God, and resigned myself       to die. The sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent       fury of the animal. He precipitated himself at full length upon       my body; but what was my astonishment, when, with a long and low       whine, he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest       eagerness, and with the most extravagant demonstration of       affection and joy! I was bewildered, utterly lost in       amazement—but I could not forget the peculiar whine of my       Newfoundland dog Tiger, and the odd manner of his caresses I well       knew. It was he. I experienced a sudden rush of blood to my       temples—a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and       reanimation. I rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which I had       been lying, and, throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful       follower and friend, relieved the long oppression of my bosom in       a flood of the most passionate tears.        As upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the       greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress.       For a long time I found it nearly impossible to connect any       ideas; but, by very slow degrees, my thinking faculties returned,       and I again called to memory the several incidents of my       condition. For the presence of Tiger I tried in vain to account;       and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures       respecting him, was forced to content myself with rejoicing that       he was with me to share my dreary solitude, and render me comfort       by his caresses. Most people love their dogs—but for Tiger I had       an affection far more ardent than common; and never, certainly,       did any creature more truly deserve it. For seven years he had       been my inseparable companion, and in a multitude of instances       had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value       the animal. I had rescued him, when a puppy, from the clutches of       a malignant little villain in Nantucket who was leading him, with       a rope around his neck, to the water; and the grown dog repaid       the obligation, about three years afterward, by saving me from       the bludgeon of a street robber.        Getting now hold of the watch, I found, upon applying it to my       ear, that it had again run down; but at this I was not at all       surprised, being convinced, from the peculiar state of my       feelings, that I had slept, as before, for a very long period of       time, how long, it was of course impossible to say. I was burning       up with fever, and my thirst was almost intolerable. I felt about       the box for my little remaining supply of water, for I had no       light, the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern, and       the phosphorus-box not coming readily to hand. Upon finding the       jug, however, I discovered it to be empty—Tiger, no doubt, having       been tempted to drink it, as well as to devour the remnant of       mutton, the bone of which lay, well picked, by the opening of the       box. The spoiled meat I could well spare, but my heart sank as I       thought of the water. I was feeble in the extreme—so much so that       I shook all over, as with an ague, at the slightest movement or       exertion. To add to my troubles, the brig was pitching and       rolling with great violence, and the oil-casks which lay upon my       box were in momentary danger of falling down, so as to block up       the only way of ingress or egress. I felt, also, terrible       sufferings from sea-sickness. These considerations determined me       to make my way, at all hazards, to the trap, and obtain immediate       relief, before I should be incapacitated from doing so       altogether. Having come to this resolve, I again felt about for       the phosphorus-box and tapers. The former I found after some       little trouble; but, not discovering the tapers as soon as I had       expected (for I remembered very nearly the spot in which I had       placed them), I gave up the search for the present, and bidding       Tiger lie quiet, began at once my journey toward the trap.        In this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever       apparent. It was with the utmost difficulty I could crawl along       at all, and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath       me; when, falling prostrate on my face, I would remain for some       minutes in a state bordering on insensibility. Still I struggled       forward by slow degrees, dreading every moment that I should       swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber, in       which event I had nothing but death to expect as the result. At       length, upon making a push forward with all the energy I could       command, I struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner       of an iron-bound crate. The accident only stunned me for a few       moments; but I found, to my inexpressible grief, that the quick       and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely       across my path, so as effectually to block up the passage. With       my utmost exertions I could not move it a single inch from its       position, it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes       and ship-furniture. It became necessary, therefore, enfeebled as       I was, either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out       a new passage, or to climb over the obstacle, and resume the path       on the other side. The former alternative presented too many       difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder. In       my present weak state of both mind and body, I should infallibly       lose my way if I attempted it, and perish miserably amid the       dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold. I proceeded,       therefore, without hesitation, to summon up all my remaining       strength and fortitude, and endeavour, as I best might, to       clamber over the crate.        Upon standing erect, with this end in view, I found the       undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to       imagine. On each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall       of various heavy lumber, which the least blunder on my part might       be the means of bringing down upon my head; or, if this accident       did not occur, the path might be effectually blocked up against       my return by the descending mass, as it was in front by the       obstacle there. The crate itself was a long and unwieldy box,       upon which no foothold could be obtained. In vain I attempted, by       every means in my power, to reach the top, with the hope of being       thus enabled to draw myself up. Had I succeeded in reaching it,       it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly       inadequate to the task of getting over, and it was better in       every respect that I failed. At length, in a desperate effort to       force the crate from its ground, I felt a strong vibration in the       side next me. I thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks,       and found that a very large one was loose. With my pocket-knife,       which, luckily, I had with me, I succeeded, after great labour,       in prying it entirely off; and getting it through the aperture,       discovered, to my exceeding joy, that there were no boards on the       opposite side—in other words, that the top was wanting, it being       the bottom through which I had forced my way. I now met with no       important difficulty in proceeding along the line until I finally       reached the nail. With a beating heart I stood erect, and with a       gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap. It did not       rise as soon as I had expected, and I pressed it with somewhat       more determination, still dreading lest some other person than       Augustus might be in his state-room. The door, however, to my       astonishment, remained steady, and I became somewhat uneasy, for       I knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to       remove it. I pushed it strongly—it was nevertheless firm: with       all my strength—it still did not give way: with rage, with fury,       with despair—it set at defiance my utmost efforts; and it was       evident, from the unyielding nature of the resistance, that the       hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up, or       that some immense weight had been placed upon it, which it was       useless to think of removing.        My sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay. In vain I       attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus       entombed. I could summon up no connected chain of reflection,       and, sinking on the floor, gave way, unresistingly, to the most       gloomy imaginings, in which the dreadful deaths of thirst,       famine, suffocation, and premature interment crowded upon me as       the prominent disasters to be encountered. At length there       returned to me some portion of presence of mind. I arose, and       felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture.       Having found them, I examined them closely to ascertain if they       emitted any light from the state-room; but none was visible. I       then forced the blade of my pen-knife through them, until I met       with some hard obstacle. Scraping against it, I discovered it to       be a solid mass of iron, which, from its peculiar wavy feel as I       passed the blade along it, I concluded to be a chain-cable. The       only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box, and       there either yield to my sad fate, or try so to tranquilize my       mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape. I       immediately set about the attempt, and succeeded, after       innumerable difficulties, in getting back. As I sank, utterly       exhausted, upon the mattress, Tiger threw himself at full length       by my side, and seemed as if desirous, by his caresses, of       consoling me in my troubles, and urging me to bear them with       fortitude.        The singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my       attention. After licking my face and hands for some minutes, he       would suddenly cease doing so, and utter a low whine. Upon       reaching out my hand toward him, I then invariably found him       lying on his back, with his paws uplifted. This conduct, so       frequently repeated, appeared strange, and I could in no manner       account for it. As the dog seemed distressed, I concluded that he       had received some injury; and, taking his paws in my hands, I       examined them one by one, but found no sign of any hurt. I then       supposed him hungry, and gave him a large piece of ham, which he       devoured with avidity—afterward, however, resuming his       extraordinary manoeuvres. I now imagined that he was suffering,       like myself, the torments of thirst, and was about adopting this       conclusion as the true one, when the idea occurred to me that I       had as yet only examined his paws, and that there might possibly       be a wound upon some portion of his body or head. The latter I       felt carefully over, but found nothing. On passing my hand,       however, along his back, I perceived a slight erection of the       hair extending completely across it. Probing this with my finger,       I discovered a string, and tracing it up, found that it encircled       the whole body. Upon a closer scrutiny, I came across a small       slip of what had the feeling of letter paper, through which the       string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it       immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal.     CHAPTER 3         The thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note       from Augustus, and that some unaccountable accident having       happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon, he had       devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of       affairs. Trembling with eagerness, I now commenced another search       for my phosphorus matches and tapers. I had a confused       recollection of having put them carefully away just before       falling asleep; and, indeed, previously to my last journey to the       trap, I had been able to remember the exact spot where I had       deposited them. But now I endeavored in vain to call it to mind,       and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious       search for the missing articles; never, surely, was there a more       tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense. At length, while       groping about, with my head close to the ballast, near the       opening of the box, and outside of it, I perceived a faint       glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage. Greatly       surprised, I endeavored to make my way toward it, as it appeared       to be but a few feet from my position. Scarcely had I moved with       this intention, when I lost sight of the glimmer entirely, and,       before I could bring it into view again, was obliged to feel       along by the box until I had exactly resumed my original       situation. Now, moving my head with caution to and fro, I found       that, by proceeding slowly, with great care, in an opposite       direction to that in which I had at first started, I was enabled       to draw near the light, still keeping it in view. Presently I       came directly upon it (having squeezed my way through innumerable       narrow windings), and found that it proceeded from some fragments       of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side. I       was wondering how they came in such a place, when my hand fell       upon two or three pieces of taper wax, which had been evidently       mumbled by the dog. I concluded at once that he had devoured the       whole of my supply of candles, and I felt hopeless of being ever       able to read the note of Augustus. The small remnants of the wax       were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel, that I       despaired of deriving any service from them, and left them as       they were. The phosphorus, of which there was only a speck or       two, I gathered up as well as I could, and returned with it,       after much difficulty, to my box, where Tiger had all the while       remained.        What to do next I could not tell. The hold was so intensely dark       that I could not see my hand, however close I would hold it to my       face. The white slip of paper could barely be discerned, and not       even that when I looked at it directly; by turning the exterior       portions of the retina toward it—that is to say, by surveying it       slightly askance, I found that it became in some measure       perceptible. Thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined, and the       note of my friend, if indeed it were a note from him, seemed only       likely to throw me into further trouble, by disquieting to no       purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind. In vain I       revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for       procuring light—such expedients precisely as a man in the       perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for       a similar purpose—each and all of which appear by turns to the       dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of       conceptions, just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties       flicker, alternately, one above the other. At last an idea       occurred to me which seemed rational, and which gave me cause to       wonder, very justly, that I had not entertained it before. I       placed the slip of paper on the back of a book, and, collecting       the fragments of the phosphorus matches which I had brought from       the barrel, laid them together upon the paper. I then, with the       palm of my hand, rubbed the whole over quickly, yet steadily. A       clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole       surface; and had there been any writing upon it, I should not       have experienced the least difficulty, I am sure, in reading it.       Not a syllable was there, however—nothing but a dreary and       unsatisfactory blank; the illumination died away in a few       seconds, and my heart died away within me as it went.        I have before stated more than once that my intellect, for some       period prior to this, had been in a condition nearly bordering on       idiocy. There were, to be sure, momentary intervals of perfect       sanity, and, now and then, even of energy; but these were few. It       must be remembered that I had been, for many days certainly,       inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a       whaling vessel, and for a long portion of that time but scantily       supplied with water. For the last fourteen or fifteen hours I had       none—nor had I slept during that time. Salt provisions of the       most exciting kind had been my chief, and, indeed, since the loss       of the mutton, my only supply of food, with the exception of the       sea-biscuit; and these latter were utterly useless to me, as they       were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched       condition of my throat. I was now in a high state of fever, and       in every respect exceedingly ill. This will account for the fact       that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last       adventure with the phosphorus, before the thought suggested       itself that I had examined only one side of the paper. I shall       not attempt to describe my feelings of rage (for I believe I was       more angry than any thing else) when the egregious oversight I       had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception. The blunder       itself would have been unimportant, had not my own folly and       impetuosity rendered it otherwise—in my disappointment at not       finding some words upon the slip, I had childishly torn it in       pieces and thrown it away, it was impossible to say where.        From the worst part of this dilemma I was relieved by the       sagacity of Tiger. Having got, after a long search, a small piece       of the note, I put it to the dog’s nose, and endeavored to make       him understand that he must bring me the rest of it. To my       astonishment, (for I had taught him none of the usual tricks for       which his breed are famous,) he seemed to enter at once into my       meaning, and, rummaging about for a few moments, soon found       another considerable portion. Bringing me this, he paused awhile,       and, rubbing his nose against my hand, appeared to be waiting for       my approval of what he had done. I patted him on the head, when       he immediately made off again. It was now some minutes before he       came back—but when he did come, he brought with him a large slip,       which proved to be all the paper missing—it having been torn, it       seems, only into three pieces. Luckily, I had no trouble in       finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left—being       guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still       emitted. My difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution,       and I now took time to reflect upon what I was about to do. It       was very probable, I considered, that some words were written       upon that side of the paper which had not been examined—but which       side was that? Fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in       this respect, although it assured me that the words (if there       were any) would be found all on one side, and connected in a       proper manner, as written. There was the greater necessity of       ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt, as the       phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third       attempt, should I fail in the one I was now about to make. I       placed the paper on a book as before, and sat for some minutes       thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind. At last I       thought it barely possible that the written side might have some       unevenness on its surface, which a delicate sense of feeling       might enable me to detect. I determined to make the experiment       and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first       presented itself. Nothing, however, was perceptible, and I turned       the paper, adjusting it on the book. I now again carried my       forefinger cautiously along, when I was aware of an exceedingly       slight, but still discernable glow, which followed as it       proceeded. This, I knew, must arise from some very minute       remaining particles of the phosphorus with which I had covered       the paper in my previous attempt. The other, or under side, then,       was that on which lay the writing, if writing there should       finally prove to be. Again I turned the note, and went to work as       I had previously done. Having rubbed in the phosphorus, a       brilliancy ensued as before—but this time several lines of MS. in       a large hand, and apparently in red ink, became distinctly       visible. The glimmer, although sufficiently bright, was but       momentary. Still, had I not been too greatly excited, there would       have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three       sentences before me—for I saw there were three. In my anxiety,       however, to read all at once, I succeeded only in reading the       seven concluding words, which thus appeared—“blood—your life       depends upon lying close.”        Had I been able to ascertain the entire contents of the note—the       full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted       to convey, that admonition, even although it should have revealed       a story of disaster the most unspeakable, could not, I am firmly       convinced, have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing       and yet indefinable horror with which I was inspired by the       fragmentary warning thus received. And “blood,” too, that word of       all words—so rife at all times with mystery, and suffering, and       terror—how trebly full of import did it now appear—how chilly and       heavily (disjointed, as it thus was, from any foregoing words to       qualify or render it distinct) did its vague syllables fall, amid       the deep gloom of my prison, into the innermost recesses of my       soul!        Augustus had, undoubtedly, good reasons for wishing me to remain       concealed, and I formed a thousand surmises as to what they could       be—but I could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution       of the mystery. Just after returning from my last journey to the       trap, and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the       singular conduct of Tiger, I had come to the resolution of making       myself heard at all events by those on board, or, if I could not       succeed in this directly, of trying to cut my way through the       orlop deck. The half certainty which I felt of being able to       accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency, had       given me courage (which I should not otherwise have had) to       endure the evils of my situation. The few words I had been able       to read, however, had cut me off from these final resources, and       I now, for the first time, felt all the misery of my fate. In a       paroxysm of despair I threw myself again upon the mattress,       where, for about the period of a day and night, I lay in a kind       of stupor, relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and       recollection.        At length I once more arose, and busied myself in reflection upon       the horrors which encompassed me. For another twenty-four hours       it was barely possible that I might exist without water—for a       longer time I could not do so. During the first portion of my       imprisonment I had made free use of the cordials with which       Augustus had supplied me, but they only served to excite fever,       without in the least degree assuaging thirst. I had now only       about a gill left, and this was of a species of strong peach       liqueur at which my stomach revolted. The sausages were entirely       consumed; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the       skin; and all the biscuit, except a few fragments of one, had       been eaten by Tiger. To add to my troubles, I found that my       headache was increasing momentarily, and with it the species of       delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first       falling asleep. For some hours past it had been with the greatest       difficulty I could breathe at all, and now each attempt at so       doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of       the chest. But there was still another and very different source       of disquietude, and one, indeed, whose harassing terrors had been       the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the       mattress. It arose from the demeanor of the dog.        I first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in       the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he       ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too       greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the       circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw       myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy.       Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my       ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting       and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his       eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him,       when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet.       Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again       awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four       times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a       degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying       close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a       kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly       convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the       confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at       a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of       killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own       safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me       with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected       every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my       terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from       the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition       should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to       pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate       my design—missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by       the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his       white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of       the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured       them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which       Augustus had left me—then, folding my cloak around me as closely       as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No       sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl       toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the       right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the       enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my       knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these       protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt       the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which       enveloped my neck—yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate       all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would       place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I       rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging       with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over       him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the       door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this       struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of       ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to       a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I       felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which       might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar       circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it       to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.        Scarcely had the echo of the crash died away, when I heard my       name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice, issuing from the       direction of the steerage. So unexpected was anything of the       kind, and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the       sound, that I endeavoured in vain to reply. My powers of speech       totally failed, and in an agony of terror lest my friend should       conclude me dead, and return without attempting to reach me, I       stood up between the crates near the door of the box, trembling       convulsively, and gasping and struggling for utterance. Had a       thousand words depended upon a syllable, I could not have spoken       it. There was a slight movement now audible among the lumber       somewhere forward of my station. The sound presently grew less       distinct, then again less so, and still less. Shall I ever forget       my feelings at this moment? He was going—my friend, my companion,       from whom I had a right to expect so much—he was going—he would       abandon me—he was gone! He would leave me to perish miserably, to       expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeons—and one       word, one little syllable, would save me—yet that single syllable       I could not utter! I felt, I am sure, more than ten thousand       times the agonies of death itself. My brain reeled, and I fell,       deadly sick, against the end of the box.        As I fell the carving-knife was shaken out from the waist-band of       my pantaloons, and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor.       Never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my       ears! With the intensest anxiety I listened to ascertain the       effect of the noise upon Augustus—for I knew that the person who       called my name could be no one but himself. All was silent for       some moments. At length I again heard the word “Arthur!” repeated       in a low tone, and one full of hesitation. Reviving hope loosened       at once my powers of speech, and I now screamed at the top of my       voice, “Augustus! oh, Augustus!” “Hush! for God’s sake be       silent!” he replied, in a voice trembling with agitation; “I will       be with you immediately—as soon as I can make my way through the       hold.” For a long time I heard him moving among the lumber, and       every moment seemed to me an age. At length I felt his hand upon       my shoulder, and he placed, at the same moment, a bottle of water       to my lips. Those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the       jaws of the tomb, or who have known the insufferable torments of       thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which       encompassed me in my dreary prison, can form any idea of the       unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest       of all physical luxuries afforded.        When I had in some degree satisfied my thirst, Augustus produced       from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes, which I devoured       with the greatest avidity. He had brought with him a light in a       dark lantern, and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less       comfort than the food and drink. But I was impatient to learn the       cause of his protracted absence, and he proceeded to recount what       had happened on board during my incarceration.     CHAPTER 4         The brig put to sea, as I had supposed, in about an hour after he       had left the watch. This was on the twentieth of June. It will be       remembered that I had then been in the hold for three days; and,       during this period, there was so constant a bustle on board, and       so much running to and fro, especially in the cabin and       staterooms, that he had had no chance of visiting me without the       risk of having the secret of the trap discovered. When at length       he did come, I had assured him that I was doing as well as       possible; and, therefore, for the two next days he felt but       little uneasiness on my account—still, however, watching an       opportunity of going down. It was not until the fourth day that       he found one. Several times during this interval he had made up       his mind to let his father know of the adventure, and have me       come up at once; but we were still within reaching distance of       Nantucket, and it was doubtful, from some expressions which had       escaped Captain Barnard, whether he would not immediately put       back if he discovered me to be on board. Besides, upon thinking       the matter over, Augustus, so he told me, could not imagine that       I was in immediate want, or that I would hesitate, in such case,       to make myself heard at the trap. When, therefore, he considered       everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with       an opportunity of visiting me unobserved. This, as I said before,       did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the       watch, and the seventh since I had first entered the hold. He       then went down without taking with him any water or provisions,       intending in the first place merely to call my attention, and get       me to come from the box to the trap,—when he would go up to the       stateroom and thence hand me down a supply. When he descended for       this purpose he found that I was asleep, for it seems that I was       snoring very loudly. From all the calculations I can make on the       subject, this must have been the slumber into which I fell just       after my return from the trap with the watch, and which,       consequently, must have lasted for more than three entire days       and nights at the very least. Latterly, I have had reason both       from my own experience and the assurance of others, to be       acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench       arising from old fish-oil when closely confined; and when I think       of the condition of the hold in which I was imprisoned, and the       long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling       vessel, I am more inclined to wonder that I awoke at all, after       once falling asleep, than that I should have slept       uninterruptedly for the period specified above.        Augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing       the trap—but I made him no reply. He then shut the trap, and       spoke to me in a louder, and finally in a very loud tone—still I       continued to snore. He was now at a loss what to do. It would       take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box,       and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by Captain       Barnard, who had occasion for his services every minute, in       arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the       voyage. He determined, therefore, upon reflection, to ascend, and       await another opportunity of visiting me. He was the more easily       induced to this resolve, as my slumber appeared to be of the most       tranquil nature, and he could not suppose that I had undergone       any inconvenience from my incarceration. He had just made up his       mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an       unusual bustle, the sound of which proceeded apparently from the       cabin. He sprang through the trap as quickly as possible, closed       it, and threw open the door of his stateroom. No sooner had he       put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his       face, and he was knocked down, at the same moment, by a blow from       a handspike.        A strong hand held him on the cabin floor, with a tight grasp       upon his throat; still he was able to see what was going on       around him. His father was tied hand and foot, and lying along       the steps of the companion-way, with his head down, and a deep       wound in the forehead, from which the blood was flowing in a       continued stream. He spoke not a word, and was apparently dying.       Over him stood the first mate, eyeing him with an expression of       fiendish derision, and deliberately searching his pockets, from       which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer.       Seven of the crew (among whom was the cook, a negro) were       rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms, where they       soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition. Besides       Augustus and Captain Barnard, there were nine men altogether in       the cabin, and these among the most ruffianly of the brig’s       company. The villains now went upon deck, taking my friend with       them after having secured his arms behind his back. They       proceeded straight to the forecastle, which was fastened down—two       of the mutineers standing by it with axes—two also at the main       hatch. The mate called out in a loud voice: “Do you hear there       below? tumble up with you, one by one—now, mark that—and no       grumbling!” It was some minutes before any one appeared:—at last       an Englishman, who had shipped as a raw hand, came up, weeping       piteously, and entreating the mate, in the most humble manner, to       spare his life. The only reply was a blow on the forehead from an       axe. The poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan, and the       black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child, and       tossed him deliberately into the sea. Hearing the blow and the       plunge of the body, the men below could now be induced to venture       on deck neither by threats nor promises, until a proposition was       made to smoke them out. A general rush then ensued, and for a       moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken. The       mutineers, however, succeeded at last in closing the forecastle       effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up.       These six, finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without       arms, submitted after a brief struggle. The mate gave them fair       words—no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield, for       they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck. The       result proved his sagacity, no less than his diabolical villainy.       All in the forecastle presently signified their intention of       submitting, and, ascending one by one, were pinioned and then       thrown on their backs, together with the first six—there being in       all, of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny,       twenty-seven.        A scene of the most horrible butchery ensued. The bound seamen       were dragged to the gangway. Here the cook stood with an axe,       striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side       of the vessel by the other mutineers. In this manner twenty-two       perished, and Augustus had given himself up for lost, expecting       every moment his own turn to come next. But it seemed that the       villains were now either weary, or in some measure disgusted with       their bloody labour; for the four remaining prisoners, together       with my friend, who had been thrown on the deck with the rest,       were respited while the mate sent below for rum, and the whole       murderous party held a drunken carouse, which lasted until       sunset. They now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the       survivors, who lay not more than four paces off, and could       distinguish every word said. Upon some of the mutineers the       liquor appeared to have a softening effect, for several voices       were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether, on       condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits. The       black cook, however (who in all respects was a perfect demon, and       who seemed to exert as much influence, if not more, than the mate       himself), would listen to no proposition of the kind, and rose       repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway.       Fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be       easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party, among       whom was a line-manager, who went by the name of Dirk Peters.       This man was the son of an Indian squaw of the tribe of       Upsarokas, who live among the fastnesses of the Black Hills, near       the source of the Missouri. His father was a fur-trader, I       believe, or at least connected in some manner with the Indian       trading-posts on Lewis river. Peters himself was one of the most       ferocious-looking men I ever beheld. He was short in stature, not       more than four feet eight inches high, but his limbs were of       Herculean mould. His hands, especially, were so enormously thick       and broad as hardly to retain a human shape. His arms, as well as       legs, were bowed in the most singular manner, and appeared to       possess no flexibility whatever. His head was equally deformed,       being of immense size, with an indentation on the crown (like       that on the head of most negroes), and entirely bald. To conceal       this latter deficiency, which did not proceed from old age, he       usually wore a wig formed of any hair-like material which       presented itself—occasionally the skin of a Spanish dog or       American grizzly bear. At the time spoken of, he had on a portion       of one of these bearskins; and it added no little to the natural       ferocity of his countenance, which betook of the Upsaroka       character. The mouth extended nearly from ear to ear, the lips       were thin, and seemed, like some other portions of his frame, to       be devoid of natural pliancy, so that the ruling expression never       varied under the influence of any emotion whatever. This ruling       expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth       were exceedingly long and protruding, and never even partially       covered, in any instance, by the lips. To pass this man with a       casual glance, one might imagine him to be convulsed with       laughter, but a second look would induce a shuddering       acknowledgment, that if such an expression were indicative of       merriment, the merriment must be that of a demon. Of this       singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring       men of Nantucket. These anecdotes went to prove his prodigious       strength when under excitement, and some of them had given rise       to a doubt of his sanity. But on board the Grampus, it seems, he       was regarded, at the time of the mutiny, with feelings more of       derision than of anything else. I have been thus particular in       speaking of Dirk Peters, because, ferocious as he appeared, he       proved the main instrument in preserving the life of Augustus,       and because I shall have frequent occasion to mention him       hereafter in the course of my narrative—a narrative, let me here       say, which, in its latter portions, will be found to include       incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human       experience, and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human       credulity, that I proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining       credence for all that I shall tell, yet confidently trusting in       time and progressing science to verify some of the most important       and most improbable of my statements.        After much indecision and two or three violent quarrels, it was       determined at last that all the prisoners (with the exception of       Augustus, whom Peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping       as his clerk) should be set adrift in one of the smallest       whaleboats. The mate went down into the cabin to see if Captain       Barnard was still living—for, it will be remembered, he was left       below when the mutineers came up. Presently the two made their       appearance, the captain pale as death, but somewhat recovered       from the effects of his wound. He spoke to the men in a voice       hardly articulate, entreated them not to set him adrift, but to       return to their duty, and promising to land them wherever they       chose, and to take no steps for bringing them to justice. He       might as well have spoken to the winds. Two of the ruffians       seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig’s side into       the boat, which had been lowered while the mate went below. The       four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered       to follow, which they did without attempting any       resistance—Augustus being still left in his painful position,       although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction       of being permitted to bid his father farewell. A handful of       sea-biscuit and a jug of water were now handed down; but neither       mast, sail, oar, nor compass. The boat was towed astern for a few       minutes, during which the mutineers held another consultation—it       was then finally cut adrift. By this time night had come on—there       were neither moon nor stars visible—and a short and ugly sea was       running, although there was no great deal of wind. The boat was       instantly out of sight, and little hope could be entertained for       the unfortunate sufferers who were in it. This event happened,       however, in latitude 35 degrees 30’ north, longitude 61 degrees       20’ west, and consequently at no very great distance from the       Bermuda Islands. Augustus therefore endeavored to console himself       with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the       land, or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels       off the coast.        All sail was now put upon the brig, and she continued her       original course to the southwest—the mutineers being bent upon       some piratical expedition, in which, from all that could be       understood, a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the Cape       Verd Islands to Porto Rico. No attention was paid to Augustus,       who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the       cabin companion-way. Dirk Peters treated him with some degree of       kindness, and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the       cook. His situation was still one of the most precarious, as the       men were continually intoxicated, and there was no relying upon       their continued good-humor or carelessness in regard to himself.       His anxiety on my account he represented, however, as the most       distressing result of his condition; and, indeed, I had never       reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship. More than once       he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my       being on board, but was restrained from so doing, partly through       recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld, and partly       through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief. For the       latter purpose he was constantly on the watch; but, in spite of       the most constant vigilance, three days elapsed after the boat       was cut adrift before any chance occurred. At length, on the       night of the third day, there came on a heavy blow from the       eastward, and all hands were called up to take in sail. During       the confusion which ensued, he made his way below unobserved, and       into the stateroom. What was his grief and horror in discovering       that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a       variety of sea-stores and ship-furniture, and that several       fathoms of old chain-cable, which had been stowed away beneath       the companion-ladder, had been dragged thence to make room for a       chest, and were now lying immediately upon the trap! To remove it       without discovery was impossible, and he returned on deck as       quickly as he could. As he came up, the mate seized him by the       throat, and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin, was       about flinging him over the larboard bulwark, when his life was       again preserved through the interference of Dirk Peters. Augustus       was now put in handcuffs (of which there were several pairs on       board), and his feet lashed tightly together. He was then taken       into the steerage, and thrown into a lower berth next to the       forecastle bulkheads, with the assurance that he should never put       his foot on deck again “until the brig was no longer a brig.”       This was the expression of the cook, who threw him into the       berth—it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended       by the phrase. The whole affair, however, proved the ultimate       means of my relief, as will presently appear.     CHAPTER 5         For some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle, Augustus       abandoned himself to despair, never hoping to leave the berth       alive. He now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of       the men who should come down with my situation, thinking it       better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of       thirst in the hold,—for it had been ten days since I was first       imprisoned, and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even       for four. As he was thinking on this subject, the idea came all       at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate       with me by the way of the main hold. In any other circumstances,       the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented       him from attempting it; but now he had, at all events, little       prospect of life, and consequently little to lose, he bent his       whole mind, therefore, upon the task.        His handcuffs were the first consideration. At first he saw no       method of removing them, and feared that he should thus be       baffled in the very outset; but upon a closer scrutiny he       discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at       pleasure, with very little effort or inconvenience, merely by       squeezing his hands through them,—this species of manacle being       altogether ineffectual in confining young persons, in whom the       smaller bones readily yield to pressure. He now untied his feet,       and, leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be       readjusted in the event of any person’s coming down, proceeded to       examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth. The partition       here was of soft pine board, an inch thick, and he saw that he       should have little trouble in cutting his way through. A voice       was now heard at the forecastle companion-way, and he had just       time to put his right hand into its handcuff (the left had not       been removed) and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his       ankle, when Dirk Peters came below, followed by Tiger, who       immediately leaped into the berth and lay down. The dog had been       brought on board by Augustus, who knew my attachment to the       animal, and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me       during the voyage. He went up to our house for him immediately       after first taking me into the hold, but did not think of       mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch. Since       the mutiny, Augustus had not seen him before his appearance with       Dirk Peters, and had given him up for lost, supposing him to have       been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging       to the mate’s gang. It appeared afterward that he had crawled       into a hole beneath a whale-boat, from which, not having room to       turn round, he could not extricate himself. Peters at last let       him out, and, with a species of good feeling which my friend knew       well how to appreciate, had now brought him to him in the       forecastle as a companion, leaving at the same time some salt       junk and potatoes, with a can of water, he then went on deck,       promising to come down with something more to eat on the next       day.        When he had gone, Augustus freed both hands from the manacles and       unfastened his feet. He then turned down the head of the mattress       on which he had been lying, and with his penknife (for the       ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him) commenced       cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks, as closely       as possible to the floor of the berth. He chose to cut here,       because, if suddenly interrupted, he would be able to conceal       what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into       its proper position. For the remainder of the day, however, no       disturbance occurred, and by night he had completely divided the       plank. It should here be observed that none of the crew occupied       the forecastle as a sleeping-place, living altogether in the       cabin since the mutiny, drinking the wines and feasting on the       sea-stores of Captain Barnard, and giving no more heed than was       absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig. These       circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and Augustus; for,       had matters been otherwise, he would have found it impossible to       reach me. As it was, he proceeded with confidence in his design.       It was near daybreak, however, before he completed the second       division of the board (which was about a foot above the first       cut), thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his       passage through with facility to the main orlop deck. Having got       here, he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main       hatch, although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of       oil-casks piled nearly as high as the upper deck, there being       barely room enough left for his body. Upon reaching the hatch he       found that Tiger had followed him below, squeezing between two       rows of the casks. It was now too late, however, to attempt       getting to me before dawn, as the chief difficulty lay in passing       through the close stowage in the lower hold. He therefore       resolved to return, and wait till the next night. With this       design, he proceeded to loosen the hatch, so that he might have       as little detention as possible when he should come again. No       sooner had he loosened it than Tiger sprang eagerly to the small       opening produced, snuffed for a moment, and then uttered a long       whine, scratching at the same time, as if anxious to remove the       covering with his paws. There could be no doubt, from his       behaviour, that he was aware of my being in the hold, and       Augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me       if he put him down. He now hit upon the expedient of sending the       note, as it was especially desirable that I should make no       attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing       circumstances, and there could be no certainty of his getting to       me himself on the morrow as he intended. After-events proved how       fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did; for,       had it not been for the receipt of the note, I should undoubtedly       have fallen upon some plan, however desperate, of alarming the       crew, and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed       in consequence.        Having concluded to write, the difficulty was now to procure the       materials for so doing. An old toothpick was soon made into a       pen; and this by means of feeling altogether, for the       between-decks was as dark as pitch. Paper enough was obtained       from the back of a letter—a duplicate of the forged letter from       Mr. Ross. This had been the original draught; but the handwriting       not being sufficiently well imitated, Augustus had written       another, thrusting the first, by good fortune, into his       coat-pocket, where it was now most opportunely discovered. Ink       alone was thus wanting, and a substitute was immediately found       for this by means of a slight incision with the pen-knife on the       back of a finger just above the nail—a copious flow of blood       ensuing, as usual, from wounds in that vicinity. The note was now       written, as well as it could be in the dark and under the       circumstances. It briefly explained that a mutiny had taken       place; that Captain Barnard was set adrift; and that I might       expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned, but       must not venture upon making any disturbance. It concluded with       these words: “_I have scrawled this with blood—your life depends       upon lying close._”        This slip of paper being tied upon the dog, he was now put down       the hatchway, and Augustus made the best of his way back to the       forecastle, where he found no reason to believe that any of the       crew had been in his absence. To conceal the hole in the       partition, he drove his knife in just above it, and hung up a       pea-jacket which he found in the berth. His handcuffs were then       replaced, and also the rope around his ankles.        These arrangements were scarcely completed when Dirk Peters came       below, very drunk, but in excellent humour, and bringing with him       my friend’s allowance of provision for the day. This consisted of       a dozen large Irish potatoes roasted, and a pitcher of water. He       sat for some time on a chest by the berth, and talked freely       about the mate and the general concerns of the brig. His       demeanour was exceedingly capricious, and even grotesque. At one       time Augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct. At last, however,       he went on deck, muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good       dinner on the morrow. During the day two of the crew (harpooners)       came down, accompanied by the cook, all three in nearly the last       stage of intoxication. Like Peters, they made no scruple of       talking unreservedly about their plans. It appeared that they       were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course,       agreeing in no point, except the attack on the ship from the Cape       Verd Islands, with which they were in hourly expectation of       meeting. As far as could be ascertained, the mutiny had not been       brought about altogether for the sake of booty; a private pique       of the chief mate’s against Captain Barnard having been the main       instigation. There now seemed to be two principal factions among       the crew—one headed by the mate, the other by the cook. The       former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which       should present itself, and equipping it at some of the West India       Islands for a piratical cruise. The latter division, however,       which was the stronger, and included Dirk Peters among its       partisans, were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out       for the brig into the South Pacific; there either to take whale,       or act otherwise, as circumstances should suggest. The       representations of Peters, who had frequently visited these       regions, had great weight, apparently, with the mutineers,       wavering, as they were, between half-engendered notions of profit       and pleasure. He dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to       be found among the innumerable islands of the Pacific, on the       perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed,       but, more particularly, on the deliciousness of the climate, on       the abundant means of good living, and on the voluptuous beauty       of the women. As yet, nothing had been absolutely determined       upon; but the pictures of the hybrid line-manager were taking       strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen, and there       was every possibility that his intentions would be finally       carried into effect.        The three men went away in about an hour, and no one else entered       the forecastle all day. Augustus lay quiet until nearly night. He       then freed himself from the rope and irons, and prepared for his       attempt. A bottle was found in one of the berths, and this he       filled with water from the pitcher left by Peters, storing his       pockets at the same time with cold potatoes. To his great joy he       also came across a lantern, with a small piece of tallow candle       in it. This he could light at any moment, as he had in his       possession a box of phosphorus matches. When it was quite dark,       he got through the hole in the bulkhead, having taken the       precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey       the idea of a person covered up. When through, he hung up the       pea-jacket on his knife, as before, to conceal the aperture—this       manoeuvre being easily effected, as he did not readjust the piece       of plank taken out until afterward. He was now on the main orlop       deck, and proceeded to make his way, as before, between the upper       deck and the oil-casks to the main hatchway. Having reached this,       he lit the piece of candle, and descended, groping with extreme       difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold. In a few       moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the       closeness of the atmosphere. He could not think it possible that       I had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so       oppressive an air. He called my name repeatedly, but I made him       no reply, and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed. The       brig was rolling violently, and there was so much noise in       consequence, that it was useless to listen for any weak sound,       such as those of my breathing or snoring. He threw open the       lantern, and held it as high as possible, whenever an opportunity       occurred, in order that, by observing the light, I might, if       alive, be aware that succor was approaching. Still nothing was       heard from me, and the supposition of my death began to assume       the character of certainty. He determined, nevertheless, to force       a passage, if possible, to the box, and at least ascertain beyond       a doubt the truth of his surmises. He pushed on for some time in       a most pitiable state of anxiety, until, at length, he found the       pathway utterly blocked up, and that there was no possibility of       making any farther way by the course in which he had set out.       Overcome now by his feelings, he threw himself among the lumber       in despair, and wept like a child. It was at this period that he       heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which I had thrown down.       Fortunate, indeed, was it that the incident occurred—for, upon       this incident, trivial as it appears, the thread of my destiny       depended. Many years elapsed, however, before I was aware of this       fact. A natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision       prevented Augustus from confiding to me at once what a more       intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to       reveal. Upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by       obstacles which he could not overcome, he had resolved to abandon       his attempt at reaching me, and return at once to the forecastle.       Before condemning him entirely on this head, the harassing       circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into       consideration. The night was fast wearing away, and his absence       from the forecastle might be discovered; and indeed would       necessarily be so, if he should fail to get back to the berth by       daybreak. His candle was expiring in the socket, and there would       be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway       in the dark. It must be allowed, too, that he had every good       reason to believe me dead; in which event no benefit could result       to me from his reaching the box, and a world of danger would be       encountered to no purpose by himself. He had repeatedly called,       and I had made him no answer. I had been now eleven days and       nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he       had left with me—a supply which it was not at all probable I had       hoarded in the beginning of my confinement, as I had every cause       to expect a speedy release. The atmosphere of the hold, too, must       have appeared to him, coming from the comparatively open air of       the steerage, of a nature absolutely poisonous, and by far more       intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my       quarters in the box—the hatchways at that time having been       constantly open for many months previous. Add to these       considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so       lately witnessed by my friend; his confinement, privations, and       narrow escapes from death, together with the frail and equivocal       tenure by which he still existed—circumstances all so well       calculated to prostrate every energy of mind—and the reader will       be easily brought, as I have been, to regard his apparent falling       off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow       than of anger.        The crash of the bottle was distinctly heard, yet Augustus was       not sure that it proceeded from the hold. The doubt, however, was       sufficient inducement to persevere. He clambered up nearly to the       orlop deck by means of the stowage, and then, watching for a lull       in the pitchings of the vessel, he called out to me in as loud a       tone as he could command, regardless, for the moment, of being       overheard by the crew. It will be remembered that on this       occasion the voice reached me, but I was so entirely overcome by       violent agitation as to be incapable of reply. Confident, now,       that his worst apprehensions were well founded, he descended,       with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of       time. In his haste some small boxes were thrown down, the noise       occasioned by which I heard, as will be recollected. He had made       considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife       again caused him to hesitate. He retraced his steps immediately,       and, clambering up the stowage a second time, called out my name,       loudly as before, having watched for a lull. This time I found       voice to answer. Overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive,       he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching       me. Having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the       labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in, he at length       struck into an opening which promised better, and finally, after       a series of struggles, arrived at the box in a state of utter       exhaustion.     CHAPTER 6         The leading particulars of this narration were all that Augustus       communicated to me while we remained near the box. It was not       until afterward that he entered fully into all the details. He       was apprehensive of being missed, and I was wild with impatience       to leave my detested place of confinement. We resolved to make       our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead, near which I was to       remain for the present, while he went through to reconnoiter. To       leave Tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to       think of, yet, how to act otherwise was the question. He now       seemed to be perfectly quiet, and we could not even distinguish       the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the       box. I was convinced that he was dead, and determined to open the       door. We found him lying at full length, apparently in a deep       stupor, yet still alive. No time was to be lost, yet I could not       bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice       instrumental in saving my life, without some attempt at       preserving him. We therefore dragged him along with us as well as       we could, although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue;       Augustus, during part of the time, being forced to clamber over       the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his arms—a feat       to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally       inadequate. At length we succeeded in reaching the hole, when       Augustus got through, and Tiger was pushed in afterward. All was       found to be safe, and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to       God for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped.       For the present, it was agreed that I should remain near the       opening, through which my companion could readily supply me with       a part of his daily provision, and where I could have the       advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure.        In explanation of some portions of this narrative, wherein I have       spoken of the stowage of the brig, and which may appear ambiguous       to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular       stowage, I must here state that the manner in which this most       important duty had been performed on board the Grampus was a most       shameful piece of neglect on the part of Captain Barnard, who was       by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the       hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would       seem necessarily to demand. A proper stowage cannot be       accomplished in a careless manner, and many most disastrous       accidents, even within the limits of my own experience, have       arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular. Coasting       vessels, in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking       in or discharging cargo, are the most liable to mishap from the       want of a proper attention to stowage. The great point is to       allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position       even in the most violent rollings of the vessel. With this end,       great attention must be paid, not only to the bulk taken in, but       to the nature of the bulk, and whether there be a full or only a       partial cargo. In most kinds of freight the stowage is       accomplished by means of a screw. Thus, in a load of tobacco or       flour, the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the       vessel that the barrels or hogsheads, upon discharging, are found       to be completely flattened, and take some time to regain their       original shape. This screwing, however, is resorted to       principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold; for       in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco, there       can be no danger of any shifting whatever, at least none from       which inconvenience can result. There have been instances,       indeed, where this method of screwing has resulted in the most       lamentable consequences, arising from a cause altogether distinct       from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo. A load of       cotton, for example, tightly screwed while in certain conditions,       has been known, through the expansion of its bulk, to rend a       vessel asunder at sea. There can be no doubt either that the same       result would ensue in the case of tobacco, while undergoing its       usual course of fermentation, were it not for the interstices       consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads.        It is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to       be apprehended from shifting, and that precautions should be       always taken to guard against such misfortune. Only those who       have encountered a violent gale of wind, or rather who have       experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the       gale, can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges,       and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose       articles in the vessel. It is then that the necessity of a       cautious stowage, when there is a partial cargo, becomes obvious.       When lying-to (especially with a small head sail), a vessel which       is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon       her beam-ends; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty       minutes upon an average, yet without any serious consequences       resulting, provided there be a proper stowage. If this, however,       has not been strictly attended to, in the first of these heavy       lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the       vessel which lies upon the water, and, being thus prevented from       regaining her equilibrium, as she would otherwise necessarily do,       she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down. It is not       too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which       vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to       a shifting of cargo or of ballast.        When a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board, the whole,       after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be       covered with a layer of stout shifting-boards, extending       completely across the vessel. Upon these boards strong temporary       stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and       thus securing every thing in its place. In cargoes consisting of       grain, or any similar matter, additional precautions are       requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port       will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its       destination—this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel       by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on       account of the swelling of the grain) the quantity consigned.       This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is       the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the       weather experienced. If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then,       is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it       will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring       about the most distressing calamities. To prevent these, every       method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo       as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances,       among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the       grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to       secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about       will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a       cargo of grain on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo.       Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is       likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with       partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without       any precaution whatever. The wonder is that no more accidents       occur than do actually happen. A lamentable instance of this       heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel       Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond,       Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The       captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although       he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his       stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had       never before sailed with a cargo of grain, and on this occasion       had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more       than half fill the vessel. For the first portion of the voyage he       met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day’s       sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E.       which forced him to lie-to. He brought the schooner to the wind       under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as       any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of       water. Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with       more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a       heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. The corn       was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement       bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a       shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira,       which picked up one of the crew (the only person saved), and       which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly       boat might have done under proper management.        The stowage on board the Grampus was most clumsily done, if       stowage that could be called which was little better than a       promiscuous huddling together of oil-casks {*1} and ship       furniture. I have already spoken of the condition of articles in       the hold. On the orlop deck there was space enough for my body       (as I have stated) between the oil-casks and the upper deck; a       space was left open around the main hatchway; and several other       large spaces were left in the stowage. Near the hole cut through       the bulkhead by Augustus there was room enough for an entire       cask, and in this space I found myself comfortably situated for       the present.        By the time my friend had got safely into the berth, and       readjusted his handcuffs and the rope, it was broad daylight. We       had made a narrow escape indeed; for scarcely had he arranged all       matters, when the mate came below, with Dirk Peters and the cook.       They talked for some time about the vessel from the Cape Verds,       and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance. At       length the cook came to the berth in which Augustus was lying,       and seated himself in it near the head. I could see and hear       every thing from my hiding-place, for the piece cut out had not       been put back, and I was in momentary expectation that the negro       would fall against the pea-jacket, which was hung up to conceal       the aperture, in which case all would have been discovered, and       our lives would, no doubt, have been instantly sacrificed. Our       good fortune prevailed, however; and although he frequently       touched it as the vessel rolled, he never pressed against it       sufficiently to bring about a discovery. The bottom of the jacket       had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead, so that the hole       might not be seen by its swinging to one side. All this time       Tiger was lying in the foot of the berth, and appeared to have       recovered in some measure his faculties, for I could see him       occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath.        After a few minutes the mate and cook went above, leaving Dirk       Peters behind, who, as soon as they were gone, came and sat       himself down in the place just occupied by the mate. He began to       talk very sociably with Augustus, and we could now see that the       greater part of his apparent intoxication, while the two others       were with him, was a feint. He answered all my companion’s       questions with perfect freedom; told him that he had no doubt of       his father’s having been picked up, as there were no less than       five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut       adrift; and used other language of a consolatory nature, which       occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure. Indeed, I began to       entertain hopes, that through the instrumentality of Peters we       might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig, and       this idea I mentioned to Augustus as soon as I found an       opportunity. He thought the matter possible, but urged the       necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt, as the       conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most       arbitrary caprice alone; and, indeed, it was difficult to say if       he was at any moment of sound mind. Peters went upon deck in       about an hour, and did not return again until noon, when he       brought Augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding. Of       this, when we were left alone, I partook heartily, without       returning through the hole. No one else came down into the       forecastle during the day, and at night, I got into Augustus’       berth, where I slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak,       when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck, and I regained       my hiding-place as quickly as possible. When the day was fully       broke, we found that Tiger had recovered his strength almost       entirely, and gave no indications of hydrophobia, drinking a       little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness.       During the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite.       His strange conduct had been brought on, no doubt, by the       deleterious quality of the air of the hold, and had no connexion       with canine madness. I could not sufficiently rejoice that I had       persisted in bringing him with me from the box. This day was the       thirtieth of June, and the thirteenth since the Grampus made sail       from Nantucket.        On the second of July the mate came below drunk as usual, and in       an excessively good-humor. He came to Augustus’s berth, and,       giving him a slap on the back, asked him if he thought he could       behave himself if he let him loose, and whether he would promise       not to be going into the cabin again. To this, of course, my       friend answered in the affirmative, when the ruffian set him at       liberty, after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew       from his coat-pocket. Both now went on deck, and I did not see       Augustus for about three hours. He then came below with the good       news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he       pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast, and that he had been       ordered to sleep, as usual, in the forecastle. He brought me,       too, a good dinner, and a plentiful supply of water. The brig was       still cruising for the vessel from the Cape Verds, and a sail was       now in sight, which was thought to be the one in question. As the       events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance, and       had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative, I       will here throw them into the form of a journal, as I do not wish       to omit them altogether.        July 3. Augustus furnished me with three blankets, with which I       contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place. No one came       below, except my companion, during the day. Tiger took his       station in the berth just by the aperture, and slept heavily, as       if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness.       Toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be       taken in, and very nearly capsized her. The puff died away       immediately, however, and no damage was done beyond the splitting       of the foretopsail. Dirk Peters treated Augustus all this day       with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him       respecting the Pacific Ocean, and the islands he had visited in       that region. He asked him whether he would not like to go with       the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those       quarters, and said that the men were gradually coming over to the       mate’s views. To this Augustus thought it best to reply that he       would be glad to go on such an adventure, since nothing better       could be done, and that any thing was preferable to a piratical       life.        July 4th. The vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from       Liverpool, and was allowed to pass unmolested. Augustus spent       most of his time on deck, with a view of obtaining all the       information in his power respecting the intentions of the       mutineers. They had frequent and violent quarrels among       themselves, in one of which a harpooner, Jim Bonner, was thrown       overboard. The party of the mate was gaining ground. Jim Bonner       belonged to the cook’s gang, of which Peters was a partisan.        July 5th. About daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the       west, which at noon freshened into a gale, so that the brig could       carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail. In taking in       the foretopsail, Simms, one of the common hands, and belonging       also to the cook’s gang, fell overboard, being very much in       liquor, and was drowned—no attempt being made to save him. The       whole number of persons on board was now thirteen, to wit: Dirk       Peters; Seymour, the black cook; Jones, Greely, Hartman Rogers       and William Allen, all of the cook’s party; the mate, whose name       I never learned; Absalom Hicks, Wilson, John Hunty Richard       Parker, of the mate’s party;—besides Augustus and myself.        July 6th. The gale lasted all this day, blowing in heavy squalls,       accompanied with rain. The brig took in a good deal of water       through her seams, and one of the pumps was kept continually       going, Augustus being forced to take his turn. Just at twilight a       large ship passed close by us, without having been discovered       until within hail. The ship was supposed to be the one for which       the mutineers were on the lookout. The mate hailed her, but the       reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale. At eleven, a sea       was shipped amidships, which tore away a great portion of the       larboard bulwarks, and did some other slight damage. Toward       morning the weather moderated, and at sunrise there was very       little wind.        July 7th. There was a heavy swell running all this day, during       which the brig, being light, rolled excessively, and many       articles broke loose in the hold, as I could hear distinctly from       my hiding-place. I suffered a great deal from sea-sickness.       Peters had a long conversation this day with Augustus, and told       him that two of his gang, Greely and Allen, had gone over to the       mate, and were resolved to turn pirates. He put several questions       to Augustus which he did not then exactly understand. During a       part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel; and little       could be done to remedy it, as it was occasioned by the brig's       straining, and taking in the water through her seams. A sail was       thrummed, and got under the bows, which aided us in some measure,       so that we began to gain upon the leak.        July 8th. A light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward,       when the mate headed the brig to the southwest, with the       intention of making some of the West India islands in pursuance       of his piratical designs. No opposition was made by Peters or the       cook—at least none in the hearing of Augustus. All idea of taking       the vessel from the Cape Verds was abandoned. The leak was now       easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an       hour. The sail was drawn from beneath the bows. Spoke two small       schooners during the day.        July 9th. Fine weather. All hands employed in repairing bulwarks.       Peters had again a long conversation with Augustus, and spoke       more plainly than he had done heretofore. He said nothing should       induce him to come into the mate’s views, and even hinted his       intention of taking the brig out of his hands. He asked my friend       if he could depend upon his aid in such case, to which Augustus       said, “Yes,” without hesitation. Peters then said he would sound       the others of his party upon the subject, and went away. During       the remainder of the day Augustus had no opportunity of speaking       with him privately.     CHAPTER 7         July 10. Spoke a brig from Rio, bound to Norfolk. Weather hazy,       with a light baffling wind from the eastward. To-day Hartman       Rogers died, having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after       drinking a glass of grog. This man was of the cook’s party, and       one upon whom Peters placed his main reliance. He told Augustus       that he believed the mate had poisoned him, and that he expected,       if he did not be on the look-out, his own turn would come       shortly. There were now only himself, Jones, and the cook       belonging to his own gang—on the other side there were five. He       had spoken to Jones about taking the command from the mate; but       the project having been coolly received, he had been deterred       from pressing the matter any further, or from saying any thing to       the cook. It was well, as it happened, that he was so prudent,       for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of       siding with the mate, and went over formally to that party; while       Jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with Peters, and hinted       that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation. There       was now, evidently, no time to be lost, and Peters expressed his       determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards,       provided Augustus would lend him his aid. My friend at once       assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that       purpose, and, thinking the opportunity a favourable one, made       known the fact of my being on board. At this the hybrid was not       more astonished than delighted, as he had no reliance whatever       upon Jones, whom he already considered as belonging to the party       of the mate. They went below immediately, when Augustus called to       me by name, and Peters and myself were soon made acquainted. It       was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the       first good opportunity, leaving Jones altogether out of our       councils. In the event of success, we were to run the brig into       the first port that offered, and deliver her up. The desertion of       his party had frustrated Peters’ design of going into the       Pacific—an adventure which could not be accomplished without a       crew, and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial,       on the score of insanity (which he solemnly avowed had actuated       him in lending his aid to the mutiny), or upon obtaining a       pardon, if found guilty, through the representations of Augustus       and myself. Our deliberations were interrupted for the present by       the cry of, “All hands take in sail,” and Peters and Augustus ran       up on deck.        As usual, the crew were nearly all drunk; and, before sail could       be properly taken in, a violent squall laid the brig on her       beam-ends. By keeping her away, however, she righted, having       shipped a good deal of water. Scarcely was everything secure,       when another squall took the vessel, and immediately afterward       another—no damage being done. There was every appearance of a       gale of wind, which, indeed, shortly came on, with great fury,       from the northward and westward. All was made as snug as       possible, and we laid-to, as usual, under a close-reefed       foresail. As night drew on, the wind increased in violence, with       a remarkably heavy sea. Peters now came into the forecastle with       Augustus, and we resumed our deliberations.        We agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the       present for carrying our designs into effect, as an attempt at       such a moment would never be anticipated. As the brig was snugly       laid-to, there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until       good weather, when, if we succeeded in our attempt, we might       liberate one, or perhaps two of the men, to aid us in taking her       into port. The main difficulty was the great disproportion in our       forces. There were only three of us, and in the cabin there were       nine. All the arms on board, too, were in their possession, with       the exception of a pair of small pistols which Peters had       concealed about his person, and the large seaman’s knife which he       always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons. From certain       indications, too—such, for example, as there being no such thing       as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary places—we began       to fear that the mate had his suspicions, at least in regard to       Peters, and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid       of him. It was clear, indeed, that what we should determine to do       could not be done too soon. Still the odds were too much against       us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution.        Peters proposed that he should go up on deck, and enter into       conversation with the watch (Allen), when he would be able to       throw him into the sea without trouble, and without making any       disturbance, by seizing a good opportunity, that Augustus and       myself should then come up, and endeavour to provide ourselves       with some kind of weapons from the deck, and that we should then       make a rush together, and secure the companion-way before any       opposition could be offered. I objected to this, because I could       not believe that the mate (who was a cunning fellow in all       matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices) would       suffer himself to be so easily entrapped. The very fact of there       being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was       upon the alert,—it not being usual except in vessels where       discipline is most rigidly enforced, to station a watch on deck       when a vessel is lying-to in a gale of wind. As I address myself       principally, if not altogether, to persons who have never been to       sea, it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel       under such circumstances. Lying-to, or, in sea-parlance,       “laying-to,” is a measure resorted to for various purposes, and       effected in various manners. In moderate weather it is frequently       done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a stand-still,       to wait for another vessel or any similar object. If the vessel       which lies-to is under full sail, the manoeuvre is usually       accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails, so as       to let the wind take them aback, when she becomes stationary. But       we are now speaking of lying-to in a gale of wind. This is done       when the wind is ahead, and too violent to admit of carrying sail       without danger of capsizing; and sometimes even when the wind is       fair, but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it.       If a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy       sea, much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water       over her stern, and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes       forward. This manoeuvre, then, is seldom resorted to in such       case, unless through necessity. When the vessel is in a leaky       condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest       seas; for, when lying-to, her seams are sure to be greatly opened       by her violent straining, and it is not so much the case when       scudding. Often, too, it becomes necessary to scud a vessel,       either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in       pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her       head to the wind, or when, through the false modelling of the       frame or other causes, this main object cannot be effected.        Vessels in a gale of wind are laid-to in different manners,       according to their peculiar construction. Some lie-to best under       a foresail, and this, I believe, is the sail most usually       employed. Large square-rigged vessels have sails for the express       purpose, called storm-staysails. But the jib is occasionally       employed by itself,—sometimes the jib and foresail, or a       double-reefed foresail, and not unfrequently the after-sails, are       made use of. Foretopsails are very often found to answer the       purpose better than any other species of sail. The Grampus was       generally laid-to under a close-reefed foresail.        When a vessel is to be laid-to, her head is brought up to the       wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when       hauled flat aft, that is, when brought diagonally across the       vessel. This being done, the bows point within a few degrees of       the direction from which the wind issues, and the windward bow of       course receives the shock of the waves. In this situation a good       vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a       drop of water, and without any further attention being requisite       on the part of the crew. The helm is usually lashed down, but       this is altogether unnecessary (except on account of the noise it       makes when loose), for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel       when lying-to. Indeed, the helm had far better be left loose than       lashed very fast, for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy       seas if there be no room for the helm to play. As long as the       sail holds, a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation,       and ride every sea, as if instinct with life and reason. If the       violence of the wind, however, should tear the sail into pieces       (a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under       ordinary circumstances), there is then imminent danger. The       vessel falls off from the wind, and, coming broadside to the sea,       is completely at its mercy: the only resource in this case is to       put her quietly before the wind, letting her scud until some       other sail can be set. Some vessels will lie-to under no sail       whatever, but such are not to be trusted at sea.        But to return from this digression. It had never been customary       with the mate to have any watch on deck when lying-to in a gale       of wind, and the fact that he had now one, coupled with the       circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes, fully convinced       us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by       surprise in the manner Peters had suggested. Something, however,       was to be done, and that with as little delay as practicable, for       there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once       entertained against Peters, he would be sacrificed upon the       earliest occasion, and one would certainly be either found or       made upon the breaking of the gale.        Augustus now suggested that if Peters could contrive to remove,       under any pretext, the piece of chain-cable which lay over the       trap in the stateroom, we might possibly be able to come upon       them unawares by means of the hold; but a little reflection       convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for       any attempt of that nature.        By good fortune I at length hit upon the idea of working upon the       superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate. It will       be remembered that one of the crew, Hartman Rogers, had died       during the morning, having been attacked two days before with       spasms after drinking some spirits and water. Peters had       expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by       the mate, and for this belief he had reasons, so he said, which       were incontrovertible, but which he could not be prevailed upon       to explain to us—this wayward refusal being only in keeping with       other points of his singular character. But whether or not he had       any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves,       we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion, and determined       to act accordingly.        Rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon, in violent       convulsions; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after       death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles I ever       remember to have seen. The stomach was swollen immensely, like       that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many       weeks. The hands were in the same condition, while the face was       shrunken, shrivelled, and of a chalky whiteness, except where       relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those       occasioned by the erysipelas: one of these blotches extended       diagonally across the face, completely covering up an eye as if       with a band of red velvet. In this disgusting condition the body       had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown       overboard, when the mate getting a glimpse of it (for he now saw       it for the first time), and being either touched with remorse for       his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight, ordered       the men to sew the body up in its hammock, and allow it the usual       rites of sea-burial. Having given these directions, he went       below, as if to avoid any further sight of his victim. While       preparations were making to obey his orders, the gale came on       with great fury, and the design was abandoned for the present.       The corpse, left to itself, was washed into the larboard       scuppers, where it still lay at the time of which I speak,       floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig.        Having arranged our plan, we set about putting it in execution as       speedily as possible. Peters went upon deck, and, as he had       anticipated, was immediately accosted by Allen, who appeared to       be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any       other purpose. The fate of this villain, however, was speedily       and silently decided; for Peters, approaching him in a careless       manner, as if about to address him, seized him by the throat,       and, before he could utter a single cry, tossed him over the       bulwarks. He then called to us, and we came up. Our first       precaution was to look about for something with which to arm       ourselves, and in doing this we had to proceed with great care,       for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding       fast, and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge       forward. It was indispensable, too, that we should be quick in       our operations, for every minute we expected the mate to be up to       set the pumps going, as it was evident the brig must be taking in       water very fast. After searching about for some time, we could       find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pump-handles,       one of which Augustus took, and I the other. Having secured       these, we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the       body overboard. Peters and myself then went below, leaving       Augustus to watch upon deck, where he took his station just where       Allen had been placed, and with his back to the cabin       companionway, so that, if any of the mate's gang should come up,       he might suppose it was the watch.        As soon as I got below I commenced disguising myself so as to       represent the corpse of Rogers. The shirt which we had taken from       the body aided us very much, for it was of singular form and       character, and easily recognizable—a kind of smock, which the       deceased wore over his other clothing. It was a blue stockinett,       with large white stripes running across. Having put this on, I       proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach, in imitation of       the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse. This was soon       effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes. I then gave       the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white       woollen mittens, and filling them in with any kind of rags that       offered themselves. Peters then arranged my face, first rubbing       it well over with white chalk, and afterward blotching it with       blood, which he took from a cut in his finger. The streak across       the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking       appearance.     CHAPTER 8         As I viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which hung up       in the cabin, and by the dim light of a kind of battle-lantern, I       was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance, and       at the recollection of the terrific reality which I was thus       representing, that I was seized with a violent tremour, and could       scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part. It was       necessary, however, to act with decision, and Peters and myself       went upon deck.        We there found everything safe, and, keeping close to the       bulwarks, the three of us crept to the cabin companion-way. It       was only partially closed, precautions having been taken to       prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without, by means of       placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with       the shutting. We found no difficulty in getting a full view of       the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges       were placed. It now proved to have been very fortunate for us       that we had not attempted to take them by surprise, for they were       evidently on the alert. Only one was asleep, and he lying just at       the foot of the companion-ladder, with a musket by his side. The       rest were seated on several mattresses, which had been taken from       the berths and thrown on the floor. They were engaged in earnest       conversation; and although they had been carousing, as appeared       from two empty jugs, with some tin tumblers which lay about, they       were not as much intoxicated as usual. All had knives, one or two       of them pistols, and a great many muskets were lying in a berth       close at hand.        We listened to their conversation for some time before we could       make up our minds how to act, having as yet resolved on nothing       determinate, except that we would attempt to paralyze their       exertions, when we should attack them, by means of the apparition       of Rogers. They were discussing their piratical plans, in which       all we could hear distinctly was, that they would unite with the       crew of a schooner _Hornet_, and, if possible, get the schooner       herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a       large scale, the particulars of which could not be made out by       either of us.        One of the men spoke of Peters, when the mate replied to him in a       low voice which could not be distinguished, and afterward added       more loudly, that “he could not understand his being so much       forward with the captain’s brat in the forecastle, and he thought       the sooner both of them were overboard the better.” To this no       answer was made, but we could easily perceive that the hint was       well received by the whole party, and more particularly by Jones.       At this period I was excessively agitated, the more so as I could       see that neither Augustus nor Peters could determine how to act.       I made up my mind, however, to sell my life as dearly as       possible, and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings       of trepidation.        The tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the       rigging, and the washing of the sea over the deck, prevented us       from hearing what was said, except during momentary lulls. In one       of these, we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to       “go forward, have an eye upon them, for he wanted no such secret       doings on board the brig.” It was well for us that the pitching       of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this       order from being carried into instant execution. The cook got up       from his mattress to go for us, when a tremendous lurch, which I       thought would carry away the masts, threw him headlong against       one of the larboard stateroom doors, bursting it open, and       creating a good deal of other confusion. Luckily, neither of our       party was thrown from his position, and we had time to make a       precipitate retreat to the forecastle, and arrange a hurried plan       of action before the messenger made his appearance, or rather       before he put his head out of the companion-hatch, for he did not       come on deck. From this station he could not notice the absence       of Allen, and he accordingly bawled out, as if to him, repeating       the orders of the mate. Peters cried out, “Ay, ay,” in a       disguised voice, and the cook immediately went below, without       entertaining a suspicion that all was not right.        My two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the       cabin, Peters closing the door after him in the same manner he       had found it. The mate received them with feigned cordiality, and       told Augustus that, since he had behaved himself so well of late,       he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for       the future. He then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum,       and made him drink it. All this I saw and heard, for I followed       my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut, and took up       my old point of observation. I had brought with me the two       pump-handles, one of which I secured near the companion-way, to       be ready for use when required.        I now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good       view of all that was passing within, and endeavoured to nerve       myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when Peters       should make a signal to me, as agreed upon. Presently he       contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the       mutiny, and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand       superstitions which are so universally current among seamen. I       could not make out all that was said, but I could plainly see the       effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present.       The mate was evidently much agitated, and presently, when some       one mentioned the terrific appearance of Rogers’ corpse, I       thought he was upon the point of swooning. Peters now asked him       if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown       overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it       floundering about in the scuppers. At this the villain absolutely       gasped for breath, and turned his head slowly round upon his       companions, as if imploring some one to go up and perform the       task. No one, however, stirred, and it was quite evident that the       whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous       excitement. Peters now made me the signal. I immediately threw       open the door of the companion-way, and, descending, without       uttering a syllable, stood erect in the midst of the party.        The intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at       all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken       into consideration. Usually, in cases of a similar nature, there       is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as       to the reality of the vision before his eyes; a degree of hope,       however feeble, that he is the victim of chicanery, and that the       apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of       shadows. It is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt       have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation, and that       the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about, is       to be attributed, even in the cases most in point, and where most       suffering has been experienced, more to a kind of anticipative       horror, lest the apparition might possibly be real, than to an       unwavering belief in its reality. But, in the present instance,       it will be seen immediately, that in the minds of the mutineers       there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a       doubt that the apparition of Rogers was indeed a revivification       of his disgusting corpse, or at least its spiritual image. The       isolated situation of the brig, with its entire inaccessibility       on account of the gale, confined the apparently possible means of       deception within such narrow and definite limits, that they must       have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance.       They had now been at sea twenty-four days, without holding more       than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever. The whole       of the crew, too—at least all whom they had the most remote       reason for suspecting to be on board—were assembled in the cabin,       with the exception of Allen, the watch; and his gigantic stature       (he was six feet six inches high) was too familiar in their eyes       to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to       enter their minds even for an instant. Add to these       considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest, and that       of the conversation brought about by Peters; the deep impression       which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the       morning upon the imaginations of the men; the excellence of the       imitation in my person, and the uncertain and wavering light in       which they beheld me, as the glare of the cabin lantern, swinging       violently to and fro, fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure,       and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even       more than the entire effect which we had anticipated. The mate       sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying, and, without       uttering a syllable, fell back, stone dead, upon the cabin floor,       and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the       brig. Of the remaining seven, there were but three who had at       first any degree of presence of mind. The four others sat for       some time rooted apparently to the floor, the most pitiable       objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered. The       only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook, John       Hunt, and Richard Parker; but they made but a feeble and       irresolute defence. The two former were shot instantly by Peters,       and I felled Parker with a blow on the head from the pump-handle       which I had brought with me. In the meantime, Augustus seized one       of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer       Wilson through the breast. There were now but three remaining;       but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy, and       perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon       them, for they fought with great resolution and fury, and, but       for the immense muscular strength of Peters, might have       ultimately got the better of us. These three men were—Jones,       Greely, and Absolom Hicks. Jones had thrown Augustus to the       floor, stabbed him in several places along the right arm, and       would no doubt have soon dispatched him (as neither Peters nor       myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists), had it       not been for the timely aid of a friend, upon whose assistance       we, surely, had never depended. This friend was no other than       Tiger. With a low growl, he bounded into the cabin, at a most       critical moment for Augustus, and throwing himself upon Jones,       pinned him to the floor in an instant. My friend, however, was       now too much injured to render us any aid whatever, and I was so       encumbered with my disguise that I could do but little. The dog       would not leave his hold upon the throat of Jones—Peters,       nevertheless, was far more than a match for the two men who       remained, and would, no doubt, have dispatched them sooner, had       it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act, and the       tremendous lurches of the vessel. Presently he was enabled to get       hold of a heavy stool, several of which lay about the floor. With       this he beat out the brains of Greely as he was in the act of       discharging a musket at me, and immediately afterward a roll of       the brig throwing him in contact with Hicks, he seized him by the       throat, and, by dint of sheer strength, strangled him       instantaneously. Thus, in far less time than I have taken to tell       it, we found ourselves masters of the brig.        The only person of our opponents who was left alive was Richard       Parker. This man, it will be remembered, I had knocked down with       a blow from the pump-handle at the commencement of the attack. He       now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom; but,       upon Peters touching him with his foot, he spoke, and entreated       for mercy. His head was only slightly cut, and otherwise he had       received no injury, having been merely stunned by the blow. He       now got up, and, for the present, we secured his hands behind his       back. The dog was still growling over Jones; but, upon       examination, we found him completely dead, the blood issuing in a       stream from a deep wound in the throat, inflicted, no doubt, by       the sharp teeth of the animal.        It was now about one o’clock in the morning, and the wind was       still blowing tremendously. The brig evidently laboured much more       than usual, and it became absolutely necessary that something       should be done with a view of easing her in some measure. At       almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea, several of which       came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle, the       hatchway having been left open by myself when I descended. The       entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away, as well       as the caboose, together with the jollyboat from the counter. The       creaking and working of the mainmast, too, gave indication that       it was nearly sprung. To make room for more stowage in the       afterhold, the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks       (a very reprehensible practice, occasionally resorted to by       ignorant ship-builders), so that it was in imminent danger of       working from its step. But, to crown all our difficulties, we       plummed the well, and found no less than seven feet of water.        Leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin, we got to work       immediately at the pumps—Parker, of course, being set at liberty       to assist us in the labour. Augustus’s arm was bound up as well       as we could effect it, and he did what he could, but that was not       much. However, we found that we could just manage to keep the       leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going. As       there were only four of us, this was severe labour; but we       endeavoured to keep up our spirits, and looked anxiously for       daybreak, when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the       mainmast.        In this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue,       and, when the day at length broke, the gale had neither abated in       the least, nor were there any signs of its abating. We now       dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard. Our next       care was to get rid of the mainmast. The necessary preparations       having been made, Peters cut away at the mast (having found axes       in the cabin), while the rest of us stood by the stays and       lanyards. As the brig gave a tremendous lee-lurch, the word was       given to cut away the weather-lanyards, which being done, the       whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea, clear of the       brig, and without doing any material injury. We now found that       the vessel did not labour quite as much as before, but our       situation was still exceedingly precarious, and in spite of the       utmost exertions, we could not gain upon the leak without the aid       of both pumps. The little assistance which Augustus could render       us was not really of any importance. To add to our distress, a       heavy sea, striking the brig to the windward, threw her off       several points from the wind, and, before she could regain her       position, another broke completely over her, and hurled her full       upon her beam-ends. The ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward       (the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some       time), and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us       from capsizing. Presently, however, we partially righted; but the       ballast still retaining its place to larboard, we lay so much       along that it was useless to think of working the pumps, which       indeed we could not have done much longer in any case, as our       hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had       undergone, and were bleeding in the most horrible manner.        Contrary to Parker’s advice, we now proceeded to cut away the       foremast, and at length accomplished it after much difficulty,       owing to the position in which we lay. In going overboard the       wreck took with it the bowsprit, and left us a complete hulk.        So far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our       longboat, which had received no damage from any of the huge seas       which had come on board. But we had not long to congratulate       ourselves; for the foremast having gone, and, of course, the       foresail with it, by which the brig had been steadied, every sea       now made a complete breach over us, and in five minutes our deck       was swept from stem to stern, the longboat and starboard bulwarks       torn off, and even the windlass shattered into fragments. It was,       indeed, hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable       condition.        At noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gale’s       abating, but in this we were sadly disappointed, for it only       lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury. About four       in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against       the violence of the blast; and, as the night closed in upon us, I       had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together       until morning.        By midnight we had settled very deep in the water, which was now       up to the orlop deck. The rudder went soon afterward, the sea       which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely       from the water, against which she thumped in her descent with       such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore. We had       all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last, as       it was unusually strong, being rigged as I have never seen one       rigged either before or since. Down its main timber there ran a       succession of stout iron hooks, and others in the same manner       down the stern-post. Through these hooks there extended a very       thick wrought-iron rod, the rudder being thus held to the       stern-post and swinging freely on the rod. The tremendous force       of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact, that       the hooks in the stern-post, which ran entirely through it, being       clinched on the inside, were drawn every one of them completely       out of the solid wood.        We had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this       shock, when one of the most tremendous waves I had then ever       known broke right on board of us, sweeping the companion-way       clear off, bursting in the hatchways, and filling every inch of       the vessel with water.     CHAPTER 9         Luckily, just before night, all four of us had lashed ourselves       firmly to the fragments of the windlass, lying in this manner as       flat upon the deck as possible. This precaution alone saved us       from destruction. As it was, we were all more or less stunned by       the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us, and which did       not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted. As soon as       I could recover breath, I called aloud to my companions. Augustus       alone replied, saying: “It is all over with us, and may God have       mercy upon our souls!” By-and-by both the others were enabled to       speak, when they exhorted us to take courage, as there was still       hope; it being impossible, from the nature of the cargo, that the       brig could go down, and there being every chance that the gale       would blow over by the morning. These words inspired me with new       life; for, strange as it may seem, although it was obvious that a       vessel with a cargo of empty oil-casks would not sink, I had been       hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this       consideration altogether; and the danger which I had for some       time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering. As       hope revived within me, I made use of every opportunity to       strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the       windlass, and in this occupation I soon discovered that my       companions were also busy. The night was as dark as it could       possibly be, and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which       surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing. Our deck lay       level with the sea, or rather we were encircled with a towering       ridge of foam, a portion of which swept over us every instant. It       is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the       water more than one second in three. Although we lay close       together, no one of us could see the other, or, indeed, any       portion of the brig itself, upon which we were so tempestuously       hurled about. At intervals we called one to the other, thus       endeavouring to keep alive hope, and render consolation and       encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it. The       feeble condition of Augustus made him an object of solicitude       with us all; and as, from the lacerated condition of his right       arm, it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings       with any degree of firmness, we were in momentary expectation of       finding that he had gone overboard—yet to render him aid was a       thing altogether out of the question. Fortunately, his station       was more secure than that of any of the rest of us; for the upper       part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered       windlass, the seas, as they tumbled in upon him, were greatly       broken in their violence. In any other situation than this (into       which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself       in a very exposed spot) he must inevitably have perished before       morning. Owing to the brig’s lying so much along, we were all       less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the       case. The heel, as I have before stated, was to larboard, about       one half of the deck being constantly under water. The seas,       therefore, which struck us to starboard were much broken, by the       vessel’s side, only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on       our faces; while those which came from larboard being what are       called back-water seas, and obtaining little hold upon us on       account of our posture, had not sufficient force to drag us from       our fastenings.        In this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to       show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us. The brig was       a mere log, rolling about at the mercy of every wave; the gale       was upon the increase, if any thing, blowing indeed a complete       hurricane, and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of       deliverance. For several hours we held on in silence, expecting       every moment that our lashings would either give way, that the       remains of the windlass would go by the board, or that some of       the huge seas, which roared in every direction around us and       above us, would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we       should be drowned before it could regain the surface. By the       mercy of God, however, we were preserved from these imminent       dangers, and about midday were cheered by the light of the       blessed sun. Shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible       diminution in the force of the wind, when, now for the first time       since the latter part of the evening before, Augustus spoke,       asking Peters, who lay closest to him, if he thought there was       any possibility of our being saved. As no reply was at first made       to this question, we all concluded that the hybrid had been       drowned where he lay; but presently, to our great joy, he spoke,       although very feebly, saying that he was in great pain, being so       cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach, that he       must either find means of loosening them or perish, as it was       impossible that he could endure his misery much longer. This       occasioned us great distress, as it was altogether useless to       think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing       over us as it did. We exhorted him to bear his sufferings with       fortitude, and promised to seize the first opportunity which       should offer itself to relieve him. He replied that it would soon       be too late; that it would be all over with him before we could       help him; and then, after moaning for some minutes, lay silent,       when we concluded that he had perished.        As the evening drew on, the sea had fallen so much that scarcely       more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the       course of five minutes, and the wind had abated a great deal,       although still blowing a severe gale. I had not heard any of my       companions speak for hours, and now called to Augustus. He       replied, although very feebly, so that I could not distinguish       what he said. I then spoke to Peters and to Parker, neither of       whom returned any answer.        Shortly after this period I fell into a state of partial       insensibility, during which the most pleasing images floated in       my imagination; such as green trees, waving meadows of ripe       grain, processions of dancing girls, troops of cavalry, and other       phantasies. I now remember that, in all which passed before my       mind’s eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus, I never fancied       any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or any thing       of that kind; but windmills, ships, large birds, balloons, people       on horseback, carriages driving furiously, and similar moving       objects, presented themselves in endless succession. When I       recovered from this state, the sun was, as near as I could guess,       an hour high. I had the greatest difficulty in bringing to       recollection the various circumstances connected with my       situation, and for some time remained firmly convinced that I was       still in the hold of the brig, near the box, and that the body of       Parker was that of Tiger.        When I at length completely came to my senses, I found that the       wind blew no more than a moderate breeze, and that the sea was       comparatively calm; so much so that it only washed over the brig       amidships. My left arm had broken loose from its lashings, and       was much cut about the elbow; my right was entirely benumbed, and       the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the       rope, which had worked from the shoulder downward. I was also in       great pain from another rope which went about my waist, and had       been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness. Looking round       upon my companions, I saw that Peters still lived, although a       thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him       the appearance of being cut nearly in two; as I stirred, he made       a feeble motion to me with his hand, pointing to the rope.       Augustus gave no indication of life whatever, and was bent nearly       double across a splinter of the windlass. Parker spoke to me when       he saw me moving, and asked me if I had not sufficient strength       to release him from his situation, saying that if I would summon       up what spirits I could, and contrive to untie him, we might yet       save our lives; but that otherwise we must all perish. I told him       to take courage, and I would endeavor to free him. Feeling in my       pantaloons’ pocket, I got hold of my penknife, and, after several       ineffectual attempts, at length succeeded in opening it. I then,       with my left hand, managed to free my right from its fastenings,       and afterward cut the other ropes which held me. Upon attempting,       however, to move from my position, I found that my legs failed me       altogether, and that I could not get up; neither could I move my       right arm in any direction. Upon mentioning this to Parker, he       advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes, holding on to the       windlass with my left hand, so as to allow time for the blood to       circulate. Doing this, the numbness presently began to die away       so that I could move first one of my legs, and then the other,       and, shortly afterward I regained the partial use of my right       arm. I now crawled with great caution toward Parker, without       getting on my legs, and soon cut loose all the lashings about       him, when, after a short delay, he also recovered the partial use       of his limbs. We now lost no time in getting loose the rope from       Peters. It had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his       woollen pantaloons, and through two shirts, and made its way into       his groin, from which the blood flowed out copiously as we       removed the cordage. No sooner had we removed it, however, than       he spoke, and seemed to experience instant relief—being able to       move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself—this was       no doubt owing to the discharge of blood.        We had little hopes that Augustus would recover, as he evinced no       signs of life; but, upon getting to him, we discovered that he       had merely swooned from the loss of blood, the bandages we had       placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water;       none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn       sufficiently tight to occasion his death. Having relieved him       from the fastenings, and got him clear of the broken wood about       the windlass, we secured him in a dry place to windward, with his       head somewhat lower than his body, and all three of us busied       ourselves in chafing his limbs. In about half an hour he came to       himself, although it was not until the next morning that he gave       signs of recognizing any of us, or had sufficient strength to       speak. By the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was       quite dark, and it began to cloud up, so that we were again in       the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard, in which       event nothing could have saved us from perishing, exhausted as we       were. By good fortune it continued very moderate during the       night, the sea subsiding every minute, which gave us great hopes       of ultimate preservation. A gentle breeze still blew from the N.       W., but the weather was not at all cold. Augustus was lashed       carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from       slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel, as he was still       too weak to hold on at all. For ourselves there was no such       necessity. We sat close together, supporting each other with the       aid of the broken ropes about the windlass, and devising methods       of escape from our frightful situation. We derived much comfort       from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them.       When we put them on after this, they felt remarkably warm and       pleasant, and served to invigorate us in no little degree. We       helped Augustus off with his, and wrung them for him, when he       experienced the same comfort.        Our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst, and       when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect,       our hearts sunk within us, and we were induced to regret that we       had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea. We endeavoured,       however, to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily       picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with       fortitude the evils that might happen.        The morning of the fourteenth at length dawned, and the weather       still continued clear and pleasant, with a steady but very light       breeze from the N. W. The sea was now quite smooth, and as, from       some cause which we could not determine, the brig did not lie so       much along as she had done before, the deck was comparatively       dry, and we could move about with freedom. We had now been better       than three entire days and nights without either food or drink,       and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt       to get up something from below. As the brig was completely full       of water, we went to this work despondently, and with but little       expectation of being able to obtain anything. We made a kind of       drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of       the companion-hatch into two pieces of wood. Tying these across       each other, and fastening them to the end of a rope, we threw       them into the cabin, and dragged them to and fro, in the faint       hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be       of use to us for food, or which might at least render us       assistance in getting it. We spent the greater part of the       morning in this labour without effect, fishing up nothing more       than a few bedclothes, which were readily caught by the nails.       Indeed, our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater       success was hardly to be anticipated.        We now tried the forecastle, but equally in vain, and were upon       the brink of despair, when Peters proposed that we should fasten       a rope to his body, and let him make an attempt to get up       something by diving into the cabin. This proposition we hailed       with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire. He       proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception       of his pantaloons; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened       around his middle, being brought up over his shoulders in such a       manner that there was no possibility of its slipping. The       undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger; for, as we       could hardly expect to find much, if any, provision in the cabin       itself, it was necessary that the diver, after letting himself       down, should make a turn to the right, and proceed under water a       distance of ten or twelve feet, in a narrow passage, to the       storeroom, and return, without drawing breath.        Everything being ready, Peters now descended in the cabin, going       down the companion-ladder until the water reached his chin. He       then plunged in, head first, turning to the right as he plunged,       and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom. In this first       attempt, however, he was altogether unsuccessful. In less than       half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked       violently (the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be       drawn up). We accordingly drew him up instantly, but so       incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder. He had       brought nothing with him, and had been unable to penetrate more       than a very little way into the passage, owing to the constant       exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself       from floating up against the deck. Upon getting out he was very       much exhausted, and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he       could again venture to descend.        The second attempt met with even worse success; for he remained       so long under water without giving the signal, that, becoming       alarmed for his safety, we drew him out without it, and found       that he was almost at the last gasp, having, as he said,       repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it. This was       probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the       balustrade at the foot of the ladder. This balustrade was,       indeed, so much in the way, that we determined to remove it, if       possible, before proceeding with our design. As we had no means       of getting it away except by main force, we all descended into       the water as far as we could on the ladder, and giving a pull       against it with our united strength, succeeded in breaking it       down.        The third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first,       and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this       manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might       steady himself, and keep to the floor of the cabin while making       his search. For a long time we looked about in vain for something       which might answer this purpose; but at length, to our great joy,       we discovered one of the weather-forechains so loose that we had       not the least difficulty in wrenching it off. Having fastened       this securely to one of his ankles, Peters now made his fourth       descent into the cabin, and this time succeeded in making his way       to the door of the steward’s room. To his inexpressible grief,       however, he found it locked, and was obliged to return without       effecting an entrance, as, with the greatest exertion, he could       remain under water not more, at the utmost extent, than a single       minute. Our affairs now looked gloomy indeed, and neither       Augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears, as we       thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us, and the       slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape.       But this weakness was not of long duration. Throwing ourselves on       our knees to God, we implored His aid in the many dangers which       beset us; and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what       could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our       deliverance.     CHAPTER 10         Shortly afterward an incident occurred which I am induced to look       upon as more intensely productive of emotion, as far more replete       with the extremes first of delight and then of horror, than even       any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine       long years, crowded with events of the most startling and, in       many cases, of the most unconceived and unconceivable character.       We were lying on the deck near the companion-way, and debating       the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom, when,       looking toward Augustus, who lay fronting myself, I perceived       that he had become all at once deadly pale, and that his lips       were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner.       Greatly alarmed, I spoke to him, but he made me no reply, and I       was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill, when I       took notice of his eyes, which were glaring apparently at some       object behind me. I turned my head, and shall never forget the       ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame,       when I perceived a large brig bearing down upon us, and not more       than a couple of miles off. I sprung to my feet as if a musket       bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart; and, stretching out       my arms in the direction of the vessel, stood in this manner,       motionless, and unable to articulate a syllable. Peters and       Parker were equally affected, although in different ways. The       former danced about the deck like a madman, uttering the most       extravagant rhodomontades, intermingled with howls and       imprecations, while the latter burst into tears, and continued       for many minutes weeping like a child.        The vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig, of a Dutch       build, and painted black, with a tawdry gilt figure-head. She had       evidently seen a good deal of rough weather, and, we supposed,       had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to       ourselves; for her foretopmast was gone, and some of her       starboard bulwarks. When we first saw her, she was, as I have       already said, about two miles off and to windward, bearing down       upon us. The breeze was very gentle, and what astonished us       chiefly was, that she had no other sails set than her foremast       and mainsail, with a flying jib—of course she came down but       slowly, and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy. The       awkward manner in which she steered, too, was remarked by all of       us, even excited as we were. She yawed about so considerably,       that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us, or       imagined that, having seen us, and discovered no person on board,       she was about to tack and make off in another direction. Upon       each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our       voices, when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her       intention, and again hold on toward us—this singular conduct       being repeated two or three times, so that at last we could think       of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the       helmsman to be in liquor.        No person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about       a quarter of a mile of us. We then saw three seamen, whom by       their dress we took to be Hollanders. Two of these were lying on       some old sails near the forecastle, and the third, who appeared       to be looking at us with great curiosity, was leaning over the       starboard bow near the bowsprit. This last was a stout and tall       man, with a very dark skin. He seemed by his manner to be       encouraging us to have patience, nodding to us in a cheerful       although rather odd way, and smiling constantly, so as to display       a set of the most brilliantly white teeth. As his vessel drew       nearer, we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his       head into the water; but of this he took little or no notice,       continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations. I relate these       things and circumstances minutely, and I relate them, it must be       understood, precisely as they _appeared_to us.        The brig came on slowly, and now more steadily than before, and—I       cannot speak calmly of this event—our hearts leaped up wildly       within us, and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and       thanksgiving to God for the complete, unexpected, and glorious       deliverance that was so palpably at hand. Of a sudden, and all at       once, there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel       (which was now close upon us) a smell, a stench, such as the       whole world has no name for—no conception of—hellish—utterly       suffocating—insufferable, inconceivable. I gasped for breath, and       turning to my companions, perceived that they were paler than       marble. But we had now no time left for question or surmise—the       brig was within fifty feet of us, and it seemed to be her       intention to run under our counter, that we might board her       without putting out a boat. We rushed aft, when, suddenly, a wide       yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had       been running, and, as she passed under our stern at the distance       of about twenty feet, we had a full view of her decks. Shall I       ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle? Twenty-five or       thirty human bodies, among whom were several females, lay       scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last       and most loathsome state of putrefaction. We plainly saw that not       a soul lived in that fated vessel! Yet we could not help shouting       to the dead for help! Yes, long and loudly did we beg, in the       agony of the moment, that those silent and disgusting images       would stay for us, would not abandon us to become like them,       would receive us among their goodly company! We were raving with       horror and despair—thoroughly mad through the anguish of our       grievous disappointment.        As our first loud yell of terror broke forth, it was replied to       by something, from near the bowsprit of the stranger, so closely       resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might       have been startled and deceived. At this instant another sudden       yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view,       and we beheld at once the origin of the sound. We saw the tall       stout figure still leaning on the bulwark, and still nodding his       head to and fro, but his face was now turned from us so that we       could not behold it. His arms were extended over the rail, and       the palms of his hands fell outward. His knees were lodged upon a       stout rope, tightly stretched, and reaching from the heel of the       bowsprit to a cathead. On his back, from which a portion of the       shirt had been torn, leaving it bare, there sat a huge sea-gull,       busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh, its bill and       talons deep buried, and its white plumage spattered all over with       blood. As the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in       view, the bird, with much apparent difficulty, drew out its       crimsoned head, and, after eyeing us for a moment as if       stupefied, arose lazily from the body upon which it had been       feasting, and, flying directly above our deck, hovered there a       while with a portion of clotted and liver-like substance in its       beak. The horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash       immediately at the feet of Parker. May God forgive me, but now,       for the first time, there flashed through my mind a thought, a       thought which I will not mention, and I felt myself making a step       toward the ensanguined spot. I looked upward, and the eyes of       Augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning       which immediately brought me to my senses. I sprang forward       quickly, and, with a deep shudder, threw the frightful thing into       the sea.        The body from which it had been taken, resting as it did upon the       rope, had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the       carnivorous bird, and it was this motion which had at first       impressed us with the belief of its being alive. As the gull       relieved it of its weight, it swung round and fell partially       over, so that the face was fully discovered. Never, surely, was       any object so terribly full of awe! The eyes were gone, and the       whole flesh around the mouth, leaving the teeth utterly naked.       This, then, was the smile which had cheered us on to hope! this       the—but I forbear. The brig, as I have already told, passed under       our stern, and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward. With       her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of       deliverance and joy. Deliberately as she went by, we might       possibly have found means of boarding her, had not our sudden       disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which       accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of       mind and body. We had seen and felt, but we could neither think       nor act, until, alas! too late. How much our intellects had been       weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact, that when       the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more       than the half of her hull, the proposition was seriously       entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming!        I have, since this period, vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew       to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the       stranger. Her build and general appearance, as I have before       stated, led us to the belief that she was a Dutch trader, and the       dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion. We might have       easily seen the name upon her stern, and, indeed, taken other       observations, which would have guided us in making out her       character; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to       every thing of that nature. From the saffron-like hue of such of       the corpses as were not entirely decayed, we concluded that the       whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever, or some       other virulent disease of the same fearful kind. If such were the       case (and I know not what else to imagine), death, to judge from       the positions of the bodies, must have come upon them in a manner       awfully sudden and overwhelming, in a way totally distinct from       that which generally characterizes even the most deadly       pestilences with which mankind are acquainted. It is possible,       indeed, that poison, accidentally introduced into some of their       sea-stores, may have brought about the disaster, or that the       eating of some unknown venomous species of fish, or other marine       animal, or oceanic bird, might have induced it—but it is utterly       useless to form conjectures where all is involved, and will, no       doubt, remain for ever involved, in the most appalling and       unfathomable mystery.     CHAPTER 11         We spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid       lethargy, gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness,       hiding her from our sight, recalled us in some measure to our       senses. The pangs of hunger and thirst then returned, absorbing       all other cares and considerations. Nothing, however, could be       done until the morning, and, securing ourselves as well as       possible, we endeavoured to snatch a little repose. In this I       succeeded beyond my expectations, sleeping until my companions,       who had not been so fortunate, aroused me at daybreak to renew       our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull.        It was now a dead calm, with the sea as smooth as I have ever       known it,—the weather warm and pleasant. The brig was out of       sight. We commenced our operations by wrenching off, with some       trouble, another of the forechains; and having fastened both to       Peters’ feet, he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the       storeroom, thinking it possible that he might be able to force it       open, provided he could get at it in sufficient time; and this he       hoped to do, as the hulk lay much more steadily than before.        He succeeded very quickly in reaching the door, when, loosening       one of the chains from his ankle, he made every exertion to force       the passage with it, but in vain, the framework of the room being       far stronger than was anticipated. He was quite exhausted with       his long stay under water, and it became absolutely necessary       that some other one of us should take his place. For this service       Parker immediately volunteered; but, after making three       ineffectual efforts, found that he could never even succeed in       getting near the door. The condition of Augustus’s wounded arm       rendered it useless for him to attempt going down, as he would be       unable to force the room open should he reach it, and it       accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common       deliverance.        Peters had left one of the chains in the passage, and I found,       upon plunging in, that I had not sufficient balance to keep me       firmly down. I determined, therefore, to attempt no more, in my       first effort, than merely to recover the other chain. In groping       along the floor of the passage for this, I felt a hard substance,       which I immediately grasped, not having time to ascertain what it       was, but returning and ascending instantly to the surface. The       prize proved to be a bottle, and our joy may be conceived when I       say that it was found to be full of port wine. Giving thanks to       God for this timely and cheering assistance, we immediately drew       the cork with my penknife, and, each taking a moderate sup, felt       the most indescribable comfort from the warmth, strength, and       spirits with which it inspired us. We then carefully recorked the       bottle, and, by means of a handkerchief, swung it in such a       manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken.        Having rested a while after this fortunate discovery, I again       descended, and now recovered the chain, with which I instantly       came up. I then fastened it on and went down for the third time,       when I became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever, in that       situation, would enable me to force open the door of the       storeroom. I therefore returned in despair.        There seemed now to be no longer any room for hope, and I could       perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made       up their minds to perish. The wine had evidently produced in them       a species of delirium, which, perhaps, I had been prevented from       feeling by the immersion I had undergone since drinking it. They       talked incoherently, and about matters unconnected with our       condition, Peters repeatedly asking me questions about Nantucket.       Augustus, too, I remember, approached me with a serious air, and       requested me to lend him a pocket-comb, as his hair was full of       fish-scales, and he wished to get them out before going on shore.       Parker appeared somewhat less affected, and urged me to dive at       random into the cabin, and bring up any article which might come       to hand. To this I consented, and, in the first attempt, after       staying under a full minute, brought up a small leather trunk       belonging to Captain Barnard. This was immediately opened in the       faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink. We       found nothing, however, except a box of razors and two linen       shirts. I now went down again, and returned without any success.       As my head came above water I heard a crash on deck, and, upon       getting up, saw that my companions had ungratefully taken       advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine,       having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before       I saw them. I remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of       their conduct, when Augustus burst into tears. The other two       endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke, but I hope never       again to behold laughter of such a species: the distortion of       countenance was absolutely frightful. Indeed, it was apparent       that the stimulus, in the empty state of their stomachs, had       taken instant and violent effect, and that they were all       exceedingly intoxicated. With great difficulty I prevailed upon       them to lie down, when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber,       accompanied with loud stertorous breathing.        I now found myself, as it were, alone in the brig, and my       reflections, to be sure, were of the most fearful and gloomy       nature. No prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering       death by famine, or, at the best, by being overwhelmed in the       first gale which should spring up, for in our present exhausted       condition we could have no hope of living through another.        The gnawing hunger which I now experienced was nearly       insupportable, and I felt myself capable of going to any lengths       in order to appease it. With my knife I cut off a small portion       of the leather trunk, and endeavoured to eat it, but found it       utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel, although I fancied       that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by       chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out. Toward night my       companions awoke, one by one, each in an indescribable state of       weakness and horror, brought on by the wine, whose fumes had now       evaporated. They shook as if with a violent ague, and uttered the       most lamentable cries for water. Their condition affected me in       the most lively degree, at the same time causing me to rejoice in       the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from       indulging in the wine, and consequently from sharing their       melancholy and most distressing sensations. Their conduct,       however, gave me great uneasiness and alarm; for it was evident       that, unless some favourable change took place, they could afford       me no assistance in providing for our common safety. I had not       yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from       below; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some       one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by       holding the end of the rope while I went down. Parker appeared to       be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others, and       I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to rouse him. Thinking       that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect, I       contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body, and then,       leading him to the companion-way (he remaining quite passive all       the while), pushed him in, and immediately drew him out. I had       good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this       experiment; for he appeared much revived and invigorated, and,       upon getting out, asked me, in a rational manner, why I had so       served him. Having explained my object, he expressed himself       indebted to me, and said that he felt greatly better from the       immersion, afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation. We       then resolved to treat Augustus and Peters in the same way, which       we immediately did, when they both experienced much benefit from       the shock. This idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me       by reading in some medical work the good effect of the       shower-bath in a case where the patient was suffering from _mania       a potu_.        Finding that I could now trust my companions to hold the end of       the rope, I again made three or four plunges into the cabin,       although it was now quite dark, and a gentle but long swell from       the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady. In the course       of these attempts I succeeded in bringing up two case-knives, a       three-gallon jug, empty, and a blanket, but nothing which could       serve us for food. I continued my efforts, after getting these       articles, until I was completely exhausted, but brought up       nothing else. During the night Parker and Peters occupied       themselves by turns in the same manner; but nothing coming to       hand, we now gave up this attempt in despair, concluding that we       were exhausting ourselves in vain.        We passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most       intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined.       The morning of the sixteenth at length dawned, and we looked       eagerly around the horizon for relief, but to no purpose. The sea       was still smooth, with only a long swell from the northward, as       on yesterday. This was the sixth day since we had tasted either       food or drink, with the exception of the bottle of port wine, and       it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while       longer unless something could be obtained. I never saw before,       nor wish to see again, human beings so utterly emaciated as       Peters and Augustus. Had I met them on shore in their present       condition I should not have had the slightest suspicion that I       had ever beheld them. Their countenances were totally changed in       character, so that I could not bring myself to believe them       really the same individuals with whom I had been in company but a       few days before. Parker, although sadly reduced, and so feeble       that he could not raise his head from his bosom, was not so far       gone as the other two. He suffered with great patience, making no       complaint, and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every       manner he could devise. For myself, although at the commencement       of the voyage I had been in bad health, and was at all times of a       delicate constitution, I suffered less than any of us, being much       less reduced in frame, and retaining my powers of mind in a       surprising degree, while the rest were completely prostrated in       intellect, and seemed to be brought to a species of second       childhood, generally simpering in their expressions, with idiotic       smiles, and uttering the most absurd platitudes. At intervals,       however, they would appear to revive suddenly, as if inspired all       at once with a consciousness of their condition, when they would       spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour, and speak,       for a short period, of their prospects, in a manner altogether       rational, although full of the most intense despair. It is       possible, however, that my companions may have entertained the       same opinion of their own condition as I did of mine, and that I       may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and       imbecilities as themselves—this is a matter which cannot be       determined.        About noon Parker declared that he saw land off the larboard       quarter, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could restrain       him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward       it. Peters and Augustus took little notice of what he said, being       apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation. Upon looking in the       direction pointed out, I could not perceive the faintest       appearance of the shore—indeed, I was too well aware that we were       far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature. It was a       long time, nevertheless, before I could convince Parker of his       mistake. He then burst into a flood of tears, weeping like a       child, with loud cries and sobs, for two or three hours, when       becoming exhausted, he fell asleep.        Peters and Augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to       swallow portions of the leather. I advised them to chew it and       spit it out; but they were too excessively debilitated to be able       to follow my advice. I continued to chew pieces of it at       intervals, and found some relief from so doing; my chief distress       was for water, and I was only prevented from taking a draught       from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus       have resulted to others who were similarly situated with       ourselves.        The day wore on in this manner, when I suddenly discovered a sail       to the eastward, and on our larboard bow. She appeared to be a       large ship, and was coming nearly athwart us, being probably       twelve or fifteen miles distant. None of my companions had as yet       discovered her, and I forbore to tell them of her for the       present, lest we might again be disappointed of relief. At length       upon her getting nearer, I saw distinctly that she was heading       immediately for us, with her light sails filled. I could now       contain myself no longer, and pointed her out to my       fellow-sufferers. They immediately sprang to their feet, again       indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy, weeping,       laughing in an idiotic manner, jumping, stamping upon the deck,       tearing their hair, and praying and cursing by turns. I was so       affected by their conduct, as well as by what I considered a sure       prospect of deliverance, that I could not refrain from joining in       with their madness, and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude       and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck, clapping my hands,       shouting, and other similar acts, until I was suddenly called to       my recollection, and once more to the extreme human misery and       despair, by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully       presented toward us, and steering in a direction nearly opposite       to that in which I had at first perceived her.        It was some time before I could induce my poor companions to       believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken       place. They replied to all my assertions with a stare and a       gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such       misrepresentations. The conduct of Augustus most sensibly       affected me. In spite of all I could say or do to the contrary,       he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us, and       in making preparations to go on board of her. Some seaweed       floating by the brig, he maintained that it was the ship’s boat,       and endeavoured to throw himself upon it, howling and shrieking       in the most heartrending manner, when I forcibly restrained him       from thus casting himself into the sea.        Having become in some degree pacified, we continued to watch the       ship until we finally lost sight of her, the weather becoming       hazy, with a light breeze springing up. As soon as she was       entirely gone, Parker turned suddenly toward me with an       expression of countenance which made me shudder. There was about       him an air of self-possession which I had not noticed in him       until now, and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he       would say. He proposed, in a few words, that one of us should die       to preserve the existence of the others.     CHAPTER 12         I had for some time past, dwelt upon the prospect of our being       reduced to this last horrible extremity, and had secretly made up       my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances       rather than resort to such a course. Nor was this resolution in       any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under       which I laboured. The proposition had not been heard by either       Peters or Augustus. I therefore took Parker aside; and mentally       praying to God for power to dissuade him from the horrible       purpose he entertained, I expostulated with him for a long time,       and in the most supplicating manner, begging him in the name of       every thing which he held sacred, and urging him by every species       of argument which the extremity of the case suggested, to abandon       the idea, and not to mention it to either of the other two.        He heard all I said without attempting to controvert any of my       arguments, and I had begun to hope that he would be prevailed       upon to do as I desired. But when I had ceased speaking, he said       that he knew very well all I had said was true, and that to       resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which       could enter into the mind of man; but that he had now held out as       long as human nature could be sustained; that it was unnecessary       for all to perish, when, by the death of one, it was possible,       and even probable, that the rest might be finally preserved;       adding that I might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him       from his purpose, his mind having been thoroughly made up on the       subject even before the appearance of the ship, and that only her       heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention       at an earlier period.        I now begged him, if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon       his design, at least to defer it for another day, when some       vessel might come to our relief; again reiterating every argument       I could devise, and which I thought likely to have influence with       one of his rough nature. He said, in reply, that he had not       spoken until the very last possible moment, that he could exist       no longer without sustenance of some kind, and that therefore in       another day his suggestion would be too late, as regarded himself       at least.        Finding that he was not to be moved by anything I could say in a       mild tone, I now assumed a different demeanor, and told him that       he must be aware I had suffered less than any of us from our       calamities; that my health and strength, consequently, were at       that moment far better than his own, or than that either of       Peters or Augustus; in short, that I was in a condition to have       my own way by force if I found it necessary; and that if he       attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody       and cannibal designs, I would not hesitate to throw him into the       sea. Upon this he immediately seized me by the throat, and       drawing a knife, made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in       the stomach; an atrocity which his excessive debility alone       prevented him from accomplishing. In the meantime, being roused       to a high pitch of anger, I forced him to the vessel’s side, with       the full intention of throwing him overboard. He was saved from       his fate, however, by the interference of Peters, who now       approached and separated us, asking the cause of the disturbance.       This Parker told before I could find means in any manner to       prevent him.        The effect of his words was even more terrible than what I had       anticipated. Both Augustus and Peters, who, it seems, had long       secretly entertained the same fearful idea which Parker had been       merely the first to broach, joined with him in his design and       insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect. I had       calculated that one at least of the two former would be found       still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with       myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose,       and, with the aid of either one of them, I had no fear of being       able to prevent its accomplishment. Being disappointed in this       expectation, it became absolutely necessary that I should attend       to my own safety, as a further resistance on my part might       possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a       sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that I       knew would speedily be enacted.        I now told them I was willing to submit to the proposal, merely       requesting a delay of about one hour, in order that the fog which       had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting, when       it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in       sight. After great difficulty I obtained from them a promise to       wait thus long; and, as I had anticipated (a breeze rapidly       coming in), the fog lifted before the hour had expired, when, no       vessel appearing in sight, we prepared to draw lots.        It is with extreme reluctance that I dwell upon the appalling       scene which ensued; a scene which, with its minutest details, no       after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree       from my memory, and whose stern recollection will embitter every       future moment of my existence. Let me run over this portion of my       narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be       spoken of will permit. The only method we could devise for the       terrific lottery, in which we were to take each a chance, was       that of drawing straws. Small splinters of wood were made to       answer our purpose, and it was agreed that I should be the       holder. I retired to one end of the hulk, while my poor       companions silently took up their station in the other with their       backs turned toward me. The bitterest anxiety which I endured at       any period of this fearful drama was while I occupied myself in       the arrangement of the lots. There are few conditions into which       man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in       the preservation of his existence; an interest momentarily       increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that       existence may be held. But now that the silent, definite, and       stern nature of the business in which I was engaged (so different       from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually       approaching horrors of famine) allowed me to reflect on the few       chances I had of escaping the most appalling of deaths—a death       for the most appalling of purposes—every particle of that energy       which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the       wind, leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable       terror. I could not, at first, even summon up sufficient strength       to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood, my fingers       absolutely refusing their office, and my knees knocking violently       against each other. My mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd       projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful       speculation. I thought of falling on my knees to my companions,       and entreating them to let me escape this necessity; of suddenly       rushing upon them, and, by putting one of them to death, of       rendering the decision by lot useless—in short, of every thing       but of going through with the matter I had in hand. At last,       after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct, I was       recalled to my senses by the voice of Parker, who urged me to       relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were       enduring. Even then I could not bring myself to arrange the       splinters upon the spot, but thought over every species of       finesse by which I could trick some one of my fellow-sufferers to       draw the short straw, as it had been agreed that whoever drew the       shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the       preservation of the rest. Before any one condemn me for this       apparent heartlessness, let him be placed in a situation       precisely similar to my own.        At length delay was no longer possible, and, with a heart almost       bursting from my bosom, I advanced to the region of the       forecastle, where my companions were awaiting me. I held out my       hand with the splinters, and Peters immediately drew. He was       free—his, at least, was not the shortest; and there was now       another chance against my escape. I summoned up all my strength,       and passed the lots to Augustus. He also drew immediately, and he       also was free; and now, whether I should live or die, the chances       were no more than precisely even. At this moment all the       fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom, and I felt toward my       poor fellow-creature, Parker, the most intense, the most       diabolical hatred. But the feeling did not last; and, at length,       with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes, I held out the two       remaining splinters toward him. It was fully five minutes before       he could summon resolution to draw, during which period of       heartrending suspense I never once opened my eyes. Presently one       of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand. The decision was       then over, yet I knew not whether it was for me or against me. No       one spoke, and still I dared not satisfy myself by looking at the       splinter I held. Peters at length took me by the hand, and I       forced myself to look up, when I immediately saw by the       countenance of Parker that I was safe, and that he it was who had       been doomed to suffer. Gasping for breath, I fell senseless to       the deck.        I recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of       the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental       in bringing it about. He made no resistance whatever, and was       stabbed in the back by Peters, when he fell instantly dead. I       must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued.       Such things may be imagined, but words have no power to impress       the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality. Let it       suffice to say that, having in some measure appeased the raging       thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim, and having       by common consent taken off the hands, feet, and head, throwing       them together with the entrails, into the sea, we devoured the       rest of the body, piecemeal, during the four ever memorable days       of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth of the       month.        On the nineteenth, there coming on a smart shower which lasted       fifteen or twenty minutes, we contrived to catch some water by       means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our       drag just after the gale. The quantity we took in all did not       amount to more than half a gallon; but even this scanty allowance       supplied us with comparative strength and hope.        On the twenty-first we were again reduced to the last necessity.       The weather still remained warm and pleasant, with occasional       fogs and light breezes, most usually from N. to W.        On the twenty-second, as we were sitting close huddled together,       gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition, there flashed       through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a       bright gleam of hope. I remembered that, when the foremast had       been cut away, Peters, being in the windward chains, passed one       of the axes into my hand, requesting me to put it, if possible,       in a place of security, and that a few minutes before the last       heavy sea struck the brig and filled her I had taken this axe       into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths. I       now thought it possible that, by getting at this axe, we might       cut through the deck over the storeroom, and thus readily supply       ourselves with provisions.        When I communicated this object to my companions, they uttered a       feeble shout of joy, and we all proceeded forthwith to the       forecastle. The difficulty of descending here was greater than       that of going down in the cabin, the opening being much smaller,       for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the       cabin companion-hatch had been carried away, whereas the       forecastle-way, being a simple hatch of only about three feet       square, had remained uninjured. I did not hesitate, however, to       attempt the descent; and a rope being fastened round my body as       before, I plunged boldly in, feet foremost, made my way quickly       to the berth, and at the first attempt brought up the axe. It was       hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph, and the ease with       which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our       ultimate preservation.        We now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of       rekindled hope, Peters and myself taking the axe by turns,       Augustus’s wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any       degree. As we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to       stand unsupported, and could consequently work but a minute or       two without resting, it soon became evident that many long hours       would be necessary to accomplish our task—that is, to cut an       opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the       storeroom. This consideration, however, did not discourage us;       and, working all night by the light of the moon, we succeeded in       effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the       twenty-third.        Peters now volunteered to go down; and, having made all       arrangements as before, he descended, and soon returned bringing       up with him a small jar, which, to our great joy, proved to be       full of olives. Having shared these among us, and devoured them       with the greatest avidity, we proceeded to let him down again.       This time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations, returning       instantly with a large ham and a bottle of Madeira wine. Of the       latter we each took a moderate sup, having learned by experience       the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely. The ham,       except about two pounds near the bone, was not in a condition to       be eaten, having been entirely spoiled by the salt water. The       sound part was divided among us. Peters and Augustus, not being       able to restrain their appetite, swallowed theirs upon the       instant; but I was more cautious, and ate but a small portion of       mine, dreading the thirst which I knew would ensue. We now rested       a while from our labors, which had been intolerably severe.        By noon, feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed, we again       renewed our attempt at getting up provisions, Peters and myself       going down alternately, and always with more or less success,       until sundown. During this interval we had the good fortune to       bring up, altogether, four more small jars of olives, another       ham, a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent Cape       Madeira wine, and, what gave us still more delight, a small       tortoise of the Gallipago breed, several of which had been taken       on board by Captain Barnard, as the _Grampus_ was leaving port,       from the schooner _Mary Pitts_, just returned from a sealing       voyage in the Pacific.        In a subsequent portion of this narrative I shall have frequent       occasion to mention this species of tortoise. It is found       principally, as most of my readers may know, in the group of       islands called the Gallipagos, which, indeed, derive their name       from the animal—the Spanish word Gallipago meaning a fresh-water       terrapin. From the peculiarity of their shape and action they       have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise. They are       frequently found of an enormous size. I have myself seen several       which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds, although       I do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them       weighing more than eight hundred. Their appearance is singular,       and even disgusting. Their steps are very slow, measured, and       heavy, their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground.       Their neck is long, and exceedingly slender, from eighteen inches       to two feet is a very common length, and I killed one, where the       distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no       less than three feet ten inches. The head has a striking       resemblance to that of a serpent. They can exist without food for       an almost incredible length of time, instances having been known       where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain       two years without nourishment of any kind—being as fat, and, in       every respect, in as good order at the expiration of the time as       when they were first put in. In one particular these       extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary, or       camel of the desert. In a bag at the root of the neck they carry       with them a constant supply of water. In some instances, upon       killing them after a full year’s deprivation of all nourishment,       as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have       been found in their bags. Their food is chiefly wild parsley and       celery, with purslain, sea-kelp, and prickly pears, upon which       latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully, a great quantity of it       being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the       animal itself is discovered. They are excellent and highly       nutritious food, and have, no doubt, been the means of preserving       the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whale-fishery       and other pursuits in the Pacific.        The one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the       storeroom was not of a large size, weighing probably sixty-five       or seventy pounds. It was a female, and in excellent condition,       being exceedingly fat, and having more than a quart of limpid and       sweet water in its bag. This was indeed a treasure; and, falling       on our knees with one accord, we returned fervent thanks to God       for so seasonable a relief.        We had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the       opening, as its struggles were fierce and its strength       prodigious. It was upon the point of making its escape from       Peter’s grasp, and slipping back into the water, when Augustus,       throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat, held it up in       this manner until I jumped into the hole by the side of Peters,       and assisted him in lifting it out.        The water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug; which, it       will be remembered, had been brought up before from the cabin.       Having done this, we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to       form, with the cork, a kind of glass, holding not quite half a       gill. We then each drank one of these measures full, and resolved       to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should       hold out.        During the last two or three days, the weather having been dry       and pleasant, the bedding we had obtained from the cabin, as well       as our clothing, had become thoroughly dry, so that we passed       this night (that of the twenty-third) in comparative comfort,       enjoying a tranquil repose, after having supped plentifully on       olives and ham, with a small allowance of the wine. Being afraid       of losing some of our stores overboard during the night, in the       event of a breeze springing up, we secured them as well as       possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass. Our       tortoise, which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we       could, we threw on its back, and otherwise carefully fastened.     CHAPTER 13         July 24. This morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and       strength. Notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were       still placed, ignorant of our position, although certainly at a       great distance from land, without more food than would last us       for a fortnight even with great care, almost entirely without       water, and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on       the merest wreck in the world, still the infinitely more terrible       distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so       providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now       endured as but little more than an ordinary evil—so strictly       comparative is either good or ill.        At sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up       something from the storeroom, when, a smart shower coming on,       with some lightning, we turn our attention to the catching of       water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose.       We had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the       sheet spread out with one of the forechain-plates in the middle       of it. The water, thus conducted to the centre, was drained       through into our jug. We had nearly filled it in this manner,       when, a heavy squall coming on from the northward, obliged us to       desist, as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we       could no longer keep our feet. We now went forward, and, lashing       ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before,       awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been       anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the       circumstances. At noon the wind had freshened into a two-reef       breeze, and by night into a stiff gale, accompanied with a       tremendously heavy swell. Experience having taught us, however,       the best method of arranging our lashings, we weathered this       dreary night in tolerable security, although thoroughly drenched       at almost every instant by the sea, and in momentary dread of       being washed off. Fortunately, the weather was so warm as to       render the water rather grateful than otherwise.        July 25. This morning the gale had diminished to a mere ten-knot       breeze, and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we       were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck. To our great       grief, however, we found that two jars of our olives, as well as       the whole of our ham, had been washed overboard, in spite of the       careful manner in which they had been fastened. We determined not       to kill the tortoise as yet, and contented ourselves for the       present with a breakfast on a few of the olives, and a measure of       water each, which latter we mixed half and half, with wine,       finding great relief and strength from the mixture, without the       distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port.       The sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at       getting up provision from the storeroom. Several articles, of no       importance to us in our present situation, floated up through the       opening during the day, and were immediately washed overboard. We       also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever, so that       we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves. On this       account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day. At noon the sun       appeared to be nearly vertical, and we had no doubt that we had       been driven down by the long succession of northward and       northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator. Toward       evening we saw several sharks, and were somewhat alarmed by the       audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us.       At one time, a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the       water, the monster actually swam in upon us, floundering for some       moments just over the companion-hatch, and striking Peters       violently with his tail. A heavy sea at length hurled him       overboard, much to our relief. In moderate weather we might have       easily captured him.        July 26. This morning, the wind having greatly abated, and the       sea not being very rough, we determined to renew our exertions in       the storeroom. After a great deal of hard labor during the whole       day, we found that nothing further was to be expected from this       quarter, the partitions of the room having been stove during the       night, and its contents swept into the hold. This discovery, as       may be supposed, filled us with despair.        July 27. The sea nearly smooth, with a light wind, and still from       the northward and westward. The sun coming out hotly in the       afternoon, we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes. Found       great relief from thirst, and much comfort otherwise, by bathing       in the sea; in this, however, we were forced to use great       caution, being afraid of sharks, several of which were seen       swimming around the brig during the day.        July 28. Good weather still. The brig now began to lie along so       alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up.       Prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency,       lashing our tortoise, waterjug, and two remaining jars of olives       as far as possible over to the windward, placing them outside the       hull below the main-chains. The sea very smooth all day, with       little or no wind.        July 29. A continuance of the same weather. Augustus’s wounded       arm began to evince symptoms of mortification. He complained of       drowsiness and excessive thirst, but no acute pain. Nothing could       be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of       the vinegar from the olives, and from this no benefit seemed to       be experienced. We did every thing in our power for his comfort,       and trebled his allowance of water.        July 30. An excessively hot day, with no wind. An enormous shark       kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon. We made       several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose.       Augustus much worse, and evidently sinking as much from want of       proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds. He       constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings, wishing for       nothing but death. This evening we ate the last of our olives,       and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not       swallow it at all without the addition of wine. Determined to       kill our tortoise in the morning.        July 31. After a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue, owing to       the position of the hulk, we set about killing and cutting up our       tortoise. He proved to be much smaller than we had supposed,       although in good condition,—the whole meat about him not       amounting to more than ten pounds. With a view of preserving a       portion of this as long as possible, we cut it into fine pieces,       and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the       wine-bottle (all of which had been kept), pouring in afterward       the vinegar from the olives. In this manner we put away about       three pounds of the tortoise, intending not to touch it until we       had consumed the rest. We concluded to restrict ourselves to       about four ounces of the meat per day; the whole would thus last       us thirteen days. A brisk shower, with severe thunder and       lightning, came on about dusk, but lasted so short a time that we       only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water. The whole       of this, by common consent, was given to Augustus, who now       appeared to be in the last extremity. He drank the water from the       sheet as we caught it (we holding it above him as he lay so as to       let it run into his mouth), for we had now nothing left capable       of holding water, unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from       the carboy, or the stale water from the jug. Either of these       expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted.        The sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the       draught. His arm was completely black from the wrist to the       shoulder, and his feet were like ice. We expected every moment to       see him breathe his last. He was frightfully emaciated; so much       so that, although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds       upon his leaving Nantucket, he now did not weigh more than forty       or fifty at the farthest. His eyes were sunk far in his head,       being scarcely perceptible, and the skin of his cheeks hung so       loosely as to prevent his masticating any food, or even       swallowing any liquid, without great difficulty.        August 1. A continuance of the same calm weather, with an       oppressively hot sun. Suffered exceedingly from thirst, the water       in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin. We       contrived, nevertheless, to swallow a portion of it by mixing it       with wine; our thirst, however, was but little abated. We found       more relief by bathing in the sea, but could not avail ourselves       of this expedient except at long intervals, on account of the       continual presence of sharks. We now saw clearly that Augustus       could not be saved; that he was evidently dying. We could do       nothing to relieve his sufferings, which appeared to be great.       About twelve o’clock he expired in strong convulsions, and       without having spoken for several hours. His death filled us with       the most gloomy forebodings, and had so great an effect upon our       spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole       day, and never addressed each other except in a whisper. It was       not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and       throw the body overboard. It was then loathsome beyond       expression, and so far decayed that, as Peters attempted to lift       it, an entire leg came off in his grasp. As the mass of       putrefaction slipped over the vessel’s side into the water, the       glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly       discovered to us seven or eight large sharks, the clashing of       whose horrible teeth, as their prey was torn to pieces among       them, might have been heard at the distance of a mile. We shrunk       within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound.        August 2. The same fearfully calm and hot weather. The dawn found       us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion.       The water in the jug was now absolutely useless, being a thick       gelatinous mass; nothing but frightful-looking worms mingled with       slime. We threw it out, and washed the jug well in the sea,       afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of       pickled tortoise. Our thirst could now scarcely be endured, and       we tried in vain to relieve it by wine, which seemed only to add       fuel to the flame, and excited us to a high degree of       intoxication. We afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings       by mixing the wine with seawater; but this instantly brought       about the most violent retchings, so that we never again       attempted it. During the whole day we anxiously sought an       opportunity of bathing, but to no purpose; for the hulk was now       entirely besieged on all sides with sharks—no doubt the identical       monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening       before, and who were in momentary expectation of another similar       feast. This circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and       filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings. We       had experienced indescribable relief in bathing, and to have this       resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could       bear. Nor, indeed, were we altogether free from the apprehension       of immediate danger, for the least slip or false movement would       have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish, who       frequently thrust themselves directly upon us, swimming up to       leeward. No shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them.       Even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by Peters and       much wounded, he persisted in his attempts to push in where we       were. A cloud came up at dusk, but, to our extreme anguish,       passed over without discharging itself. It is quite impossible to       conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period. We passed a       sleepless night, both on this account and through dread of the       sharks.        August 3. No prospect of relief, and the brig lying still more       and more along, so that now we could not maintain a footing upon       deck at all. Busied ourselves in securing our wine and       tortoise-meat, so that we might not lose them in the event of our       rolling over. Got out two stout spikes from the forechains, and,       by means of the axe, drove them into the hull to windward within       a couple of feet of the water, this not being very far from the       keel, as we were nearly upon our beam-ends. To these spikes we       now lashed our provisions, as being more secure than their former       position beneath the chains. Suffered great agony from thirst       during the whole day—no chance of bathing on account of the       sharks, which never left us for a moment. Found it impossible to       sleep.        August 4. A little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was       heeling over, and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off       by the movement. At first the roll was slow and gradual, and we       contrived to clamber over to windward very well, having taken the       precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven       in for the provision. But we had not calculated sufficiently upon       the acceleration of the impetus; for, presently the heel became       too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it; and, before       either of us knew what was to happen, we found ourselves hurled       furiously into the sea, and struggling several fathoms beneath       the surface, with the huge hull immediately above us.        In going under the water I had been obliged to let go my hold       upon the rope; and finding that I was completely beneath the       vessel, and my strength nearly exhausted, I scarcely made a       struggle for life, and resigned myself, in a few seconds, to die.       But here again I was deceived, not having taken into       consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward. The       whirl of the water upward, which the vessel occasioned in rolling       partially back, brought me to the surface still more violently       than I had been plunged beneath. Upon coming up I found myself       about twenty yards from the hulk, as near as I could judge. She       was lying keel up, rocking furiously from side to side, and the       sea in all directions around was much agitated, and full of       strong whirlpools. I could see nothing of Peters. An oil-cask was       floating within a few feet of me, and various other articles from       the brig were scattered about.        My principal terror was now on account of the sharks, which I       knew to be in my vicinity. In order to deter these, if possible,       from approaching me, I splashed the water vigorously with both       hands and feet as I swam towards the hulk, creating a body of       foam. I have no doubt that to this expedient, simple as it was, I       was indebted for my preservation; for the sea all round the brig,       just before her rolling over, was so crowded with these monsters,       that I must have been, and really was, in actual contact with       some of them during my progress. By great good fortune, however,       I reached the side of the vessel in safety, although so utterly       weakened by the violent exertion I had used that I should never       have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of       Peters, who, now, to my great joy, made his appearance (having       scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull), and       threw me the end of a rope—one of those which had been attached       to the spikes.        Having barely escaped this danger, our attention was now directed       to the dreadful imminency of another—that of absolute starvation.       Our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of       all our care in securing it; and seeing no longer the remotest       possibility of obtaining more, we gave way both of us to despair,       weeping aloud like children, and neither of us attempting to       offer consolation to the other. Such weakness can scarcely be       conceived, and to those who have never been similarly situated       will, no doubt, appear unnatural; but it must be remembered that       our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of       privation and terror to which we had been subjected, that we       could not justly be considered, at that period, in the light of       rational beings. In subsequent perils, nearly as great, if not       greater, I bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my       situation, and Peters, it will be seen, evinced a stoical       philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike       supineness and imbecility—the mental condition made the       difference.        The overturning of the brig, even with the consequent loss of the       wine and turtle, would not, in fact, have rendered our situation       more deplorable than before, except for the disappearance of the       bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch       rainwater, and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught;       for we found the whole bottom, from within two or three feet of       the bends as far as the keel, together with the keel itself,       thickly covered with large barnacles, which proved to be       excellent and highly nutritious food. Thus, in two important       respects, the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a       benefit rather than an injury; it had opened to us a supply of       provisions which we could not have exhausted, using it       moderately, in a month; and it had greatly contributed to our       comfort as regards position, we being much more at ease, and in       infinitely less danger, than before.        The difficulty, however, of now obtaining water blinded us to all       the benefits of the change in our condition. That we might be       ready to avail ourselves, as far as possible, of any shower which       might fall we took off our shirts, to make use of them as we had       of the sheets—not hoping, of course, to get more in this way,       even under the most favorable circumstances, than half a gill at       a time. No signs of a cloud appeared during the day, and the       agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable. At night, Peters       obtained about an hour’s disturbed sleep, but my intense       sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single       moment.        August 5. To-day, a gentle breeze springing up carried us through       a vast quantity of seaweed, among which we were so fortunate as       to find eleven small crabs, which afforded us several delicious       meals. Their shells being quite soft, we ate them entire, and       found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles.       Seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed, we also ventured to       bathe, and remained in the water for four or five hours, during       which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst.       Were greatly refreshed, and spent the night somewhat more       comfortably than before, both of us snatching a little sleep.        August 6. This day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain,       lasting from about noon until after dark. Bitterly did we now       regret the loss of our jug and carboy; for, in spite of the       little means we had of catching the water, we might have filled       one, if not both of them. As it was, we contrived to satisfy the       cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated,       and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle       into our mouths. In this occupation we passed the entire day.        August 7. Just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a       sail to the eastward, and _evidently coming towards us!_ We       hailed the glorious sight with a long, although feeble shout of       rapture; and began instantly to make every signal in our power,       by flaring the shirts in the air, leaping as high as our weak       condition would permit, and even by hallooing with all the       strength of our lungs, although the vessel could not have been       less than fifteen miles distant. However, she still continued to       near our hulk, and we felt that, if she but held her present       course, she must eventually come so close as to perceive us. In       about an hour after we first discovered her, we could clearly see       the people on her decks. She was a long, low, and rakish-looking       topsail schooner, with a black ball in her foretopsail, and had,       apparently, a full crew. We now became alarmed, for we could       hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us, and were       apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were—an       act of fiendish barbarity, which, however incredible it may       appear, has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea, under       circumstances very nearly similar, and by beings who were       regarded as belonging to the human species. {*2} In this       instance, however, by the mercy of God, we were destined to be       most happily deceived; for, presently we were aware of a sudden       commotion on the deck of the stranger, who immediately afterward       ran up a British flag, and, hauling her wind, bore up directly       upon us. In half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin.       She proved to be the Jane Guy, of Liverpool, Captain Guy, bound       on a sealing and trading voyage to the South Seas and Pacific.     CHAPTER 14         The _Jane Guy_ was a fine-looking topsail schooner of a hundred       and eighty tons burden. She was unusually sharp in the bows, and       on a wind, in moderate weather, the fastest sailer I have ever       seen. Her qualities, however, as a rough sea-boat, were not so       good, and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade       to which she was destined. For this peculiar service, a larger       vessel, and one of a light proportionate draught, is       desirable—say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and       fifty tons. She should be bark-rigged, and in other respects of a       different construction from the usual South Sea ships. It is       absolutely necessary that she should be well armed. She should       have, say ten or twelve twelve-pound carronades, and two or three       long twelves, with brass blunderbusses, and water-tight       arm-chests for each top. Her anchors and cables should be of far       greater strength than is required for any other species of trade,       and, above all, her crew should be numerous and efficient—not       less, for such a vessel as I have described, than fifty or sixty       able-bodied men. The Jane Guy had a crew of thirty-five, all able       seamen, besides the captain and mate, but she was not altogether       as well armed or otherwise equipped, as a navigator acquainted       with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have       desired.        Captain Guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner, and of       considerable experience in the southern traffic, to which he had       devoted a great portion of his life. He was deficient, however,       in energy, and, consequently, in that spirit of enterprise which       is here so absolutely requisite. He was part owner of the vessel       in which he sailed, and was invested with discretionary powers to       cruise in the South Seas for any cargo which might come most       readily to hand. He had on board, as usual in such voyages,       beads, looking-glasses, tinder-works, axes, hatchets, saws,       adzes, planes, chisels, gouges, gimlets, files, spokeshaves,       rasps, hammers, nails, knives, scissors, razors, needles, thread,       crockery-ware, calico, trinkets, and other similar articles.        The schooner sailed from Liverpool on the tenth of July, crossed       the Tropic of Cancer on the twenty-fifth, in longitude twenty       degrees west, and reached Sal, one of the Cape Verd islands, on       the twenty-ninth, where she took in salt and other necessaries       for the voyage. On the third of August, she left the Cape Verds       and steered southwest, stretching over toward the coast of       Brazil, so as to cross the equator between the meridians of       twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude. This is the       course usually taken by vessels bound from Europe to the Cape of       Good Hope, or by that route to the East Indies. By proceeding       thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which       continually prevail on the coast of Guinea, while, in the end, it       is found to be the shortest track, as westerly winds are never       wanting afterward by which to reach the Cape. It was Captain       Guy’s intention to make his first stoppage at Kerguelen’s Land—I       hardly know for what reason. On the day we were picked up the       schooner was off Cape St. Roque, in longitude thirty-one degrees       west; so that, when found, we had drifted probably, from north to       south, _not less than five-and-twenty degrees!_        On board the Jane Guy we were treated with all the kindness our       distressed situation demanded. In about a fortnight, during which       time we continued steering to the southeast, with gentle breezes       and fine weather, both Peters and myself recovered entirely from       the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings, and we       began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream       from which we had been happily awakened, than as events which had       taken place in sober and naked reality. I have since found that       this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by       sudden transition, whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to       joy—the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree       of difference in the exchange. Thus, in my own case, I now feel       it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which I       endured during the days spent upon the hulk. The incidents are       remembered, but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at       the time of their occurrence. I only know, that when they did       occur, I then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of       agony.        We continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of       greater moment than the occasional meeting with whaling-ships,       and more frequently with the black or right whale, so called in       contradistinction to the spermaceti. These, however, were chiefly       found south of the twenty-fifth parallel. On the sixteenth of       September, being in the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope, the       schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving       Liverpool. In this neighborhood, but more frequently to the south       and east of the promontory (we were to the westward), navigators       have often to contend with storms from the northward, which rage       with great fury. They always bring with them a heavy sea, and one       of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping       round of the wind, an occurrence almost certain to take place       during the greatest force of the gale. A perfect hurricane will       be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast, and in       the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction,       while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a       violence almost inconceivable. A bright spot to the southward is       the sure forerunner of the change, and vessels are thus enabled       to take the proper precautions.        It was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a       white squall, and, as usual, from the northward. By eight it had       increased very much, and brought down upon us one of the most       tremendous seas I had then ever beheld. Every thing had been made       as snug as possible, but the schooner laboured excessively, and       gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat, pitching her       forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty       struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another.       Just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the       look-out made its appearance in the southwest, and in an hour       afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping       listlessly against the mast. In two minutes more, in spite of       every preparation, we were hurled on our beam-ends, as if by       magic, and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over       us as we lay. The blow from the southwest, however, luckily       proved to be nothing more than a squall, and we had the good       fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar. A heavy       cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this, but       toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as       before the gale. Captain Guy considered that he had made an       escape little less than miraculous.        On the thirteenth of October we came in sight of Prince Edward’s       Island, in latitude 46 degrees 53’ S., longitude 37 degrees 46’       E. Two days afterward we found ourselves near Possession Island,       and presently passed the islands of Crozet, in latitude 42       degrees 59’ S., longitude 48 degrees E. On the eighteenth we made       Kerguelen’s or Desolation Island, in the Southern Indian Ocean,       and came to anchor in Christmas Harbour, having four fathoms of       water.        This island, or rather group of islands, bears southeast from the       Cape of Good Hope, and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred       leagues. It was first discovered in 1772, by the Baron de       Kergulen, or Kerguelen, a Frenchman, who, thinking the land to       form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home       information to that effect, which produced much excitement at the       time. The government, taking the matter up, sent the baron back       in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery       a critical examination, when the mistake was discovered. In 1777,       Captain Cook fell in with the same group, and gave to the       principal one the name of Desolation Island, a title which it       certainly well deserves. Upon approaching the land, however, the       navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise, as the sides of       most of the hills, from September to March, are clothed with very       brilliant verdure. This deceitful appearance is caused by a small       plant resembling saxifrage, which is abundant, growing in large       patches on a species of crumbling moss. Besides this plant there       is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island, if we except some       coarse rank grass near the harbor, some lichen, and a shrub which       bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed, and which has       a bitter and acrid taste.        The face of the country is hilly, although none of the hills can       be called lofty. Their tops are perpetually covered with snow.       There are several harbors, of which Christmas Harbour is the most       convenient. It is the first to be met with on the northeast side       of the island after passing Cape Francois, which forms the       northern shore, and, by its peculiar shape, serves to distinguish       the harbour. Its projecting point terminates in a high rock,       through which is a large hole, forming a natural arch. The       entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40’ S., longitude 69 degrees       6’ E. Passing in here, good anchorage may be found under the       shelter of several small islands, which form a sufficient       protection from all easterly winds. Proceeding on eastwardly from       this anchorage you come to Wasp Bay, at the head of the harbour.       This is a small basin, completely landlocked, into which you can       go with four fathoms, and find anchorage in from ten to three,       hard clay bottom. A ship might lie here with her best bower ahead       all the year round without risk. To the westward, at the head of       Wasp Bay, is a small stream of excellent water, easily procured.        Some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on       Kerguelen’s Island, and sea elephants abound. The feathered       tribes are discovered in great numbers. Penguins are very plenty,       and of these there are four different kinds. The royal penguin,       so called from its size and beautiful plumage, is the largest.       The upper part of the body is usually gray, sometimes of a lilac       tint; the under portion of the purest white imaginable. The head       is of a glossy and most brilliant black, the feet also. The chief       beauty of plumage, however, consists in two broad stripes of a       gold color, which pass along from the head to the breast. The       bill is long, and either pink or bright scarlet. These birds walk       erect; with a stately carriage. They carry their heads high with       their wings drooping like two arms, and, as their tails project       from their body in a line with the legs, the resemblance to a       human figure is very striking, and would be apt to deceive the       spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening. The       royal penguins which we met with on Kerguelen’s Land were rather       larger than a goose. The other kinds are the macaroni, the       jackass, and the rookery penguin. These are much smaller, less       beautiful in plumage, and different in other respects.        Besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found, among       which may be mentioned sea-hens, blue peterels, teal, ducks, Port       Egmont hens, shags, Cape pigeons, the nelly, sea swallows, terns,       sea gulls, Mother Carey’s chickens, Mother Carey’s geese, or the       great peterel, and, lastly, the albatross.        The great peterel is as large as the common albatross, and is       carnivorous. It is frequently called the break-bones, or osprey       peterel. They are not at all shy, and, when properly cooked, are       palatable food. In flying they sometimes sail very close to the       surface of the water, with the wings expanded, without appearing       to move them in the least degree, or make any exertion with them       whatever.        The albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the South Sea       birds. It is of the gull species, and takes its prey on the wing,       never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding. Between       this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists.       Their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan       concerted between the two species—that of the albatross being       placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of       four penguins. Navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of       such encampments a rookery. These rookeries have been often       described, but as my readers may not all have seen these       descriptions, and as I shall have occasion hereafter to speak of       the penguin and albatross, it will not be amiss to say something       here of their mode of building and living.        When the season for incubation arrives, the birds assemble in       vast numbers, and for some days appear to be deliberating upon       the proper course to be pursued. At length they proceed to       action. A level piece of ground is selected, of suitable extent,       usually comprising three or four acres, and situated as near the       sea as possible, being still beyond its reach. The spot is chosen       with reference to its evenness of surface, and that is preferred       which is the least encumbered with stones. This matter being       arranged, the birds proceed, with one accord, and actuated       apparently by one mind, to trace out, with mathematical accuracy,       either a square or other parallelogram, as may best suit the       nature of the ground, and of just sufficient size to accommodate       easily all the birds assembled, and no more—in this particular       seeming determined upon preventing the access of future       stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the       encampment. One side of the place thus marked out runs parallel       with the water’s edge, and is left open for ingress or egress.        Having defined the limits of the rookery, the colony now begin to       clear it of every species of rubbish, picking up stone by stone,       and carrying them outside of the lines, and close by them, so as       to form a wall on the three inland sides. Just within this wall a       perfectly level and smooth walk is formed, from six to eight feet       wide, and extending around the encampment—thus serving the       purpose of a general promenade.        The next process is to partition out the whole area into small       squares exactly equal in size. This is done by forming narrow       paths, very smooth, and crossing each other at right angles       throughout the entire extent of the rookery. At each intersection       of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed, and a       penguin’s nest in the centre of each square—thus every penguin is       surrounded by four albatrosses, and each albatross by a like       number of penguins. The penguin’s nest consists of a hole in the       earth, very shallow, being only just of sufficient depth to keep       her single egg from rolling. The albatross is somewhat less       simple in her arrangements, erecting a hillock about a foot high       and two in diameter. This is made of earth, seaweed, and shells.       On its summit she builds her nest.        The birds take especial care never to leave their nests       unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation, or,       indeed, until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take       care of themselves. While the male is absent at sea in search of       food, the female remains on duty, and it is only upon the return       of her partner that she ventures abroad. The eggs are never left       uncovered at all—while one bird leaves the nest the other       nestling in by its side. This precaution is rendered necessary by       the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery, the       inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each other’s eggs at       every good opportunity.        Although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and       albatross are the sole population, yet in most of them a variety       of oceanic birds are to be met with, enjoying all the privileges       of citizenship, and scattering their nests here and there,       wherever they can find room, never interfering, however, with the       stations of the larger species. The appearance of such       encampments, when seen from a distance, is exceedingly singular.       The whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with       the immense number of the albatross (mingled with the smaller       tribes) which are continually hovering over it, either going to       the ocean or returning home. At the same time a crowd of penguins       are to be observed, some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys,       and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them,       around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery.       In short, survey it as we will, nothing can be more astonishing       than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings,       and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection       in every well-regulated human intellect.        On the morning after our arrival in Christmas Harbour the chief       mate, Mr. Patterson, took the boats, and (although it was       somewhat early in the season) went in search of seal, leaving the       captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to       the westward, they having some business, whose nature I could not       ascertain, to transact in the interior of the island. Captain Guy       took with him a bottle, in which was a sealed letter, and made       his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of       the highest peaks in the place. It is probable that his design       was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he       expected to come after him. As soon as we lost sight of him we       proceeded (Peters and myself being in the mate’s boat) on our       cruise around the coast, looking for seal. In this business we       were occupied about three weeks, examining with great care every       nook and corner, not only of Kerguelen’s Land, but of the several       small islands in the vicinity. Our labours, however, were not       crowned with any important success. We saw a great many fur seal,       but they were exceedingly shy, and with the greatest exertions,       we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all. Sea       elephants were abundant, especially on the western coast of the       mainland, but of these we killed only twenty, and this with great       difficulty. On the smaller islands we discovered a good many of       the hair seal, but did not molest them. We returned to the       schooner on the eleventh, where we found Captain Guy and his       nephew, who gave a very bad account of the interior, representing       it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the       world. They had remained two nights on the island, owing to some       misunderstanding, on the part of the second mate, in regard to       the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off.     CHAPTER 15         On the twelfth we made sail from Christmas Harbour retracing our       way to the westward, and leaving Marion’s Island, one of Crozet’s       group, on the larboard. We afterward passed Prince Edward’s       Island, leaving it also on our left, then, steering more to the       northward, made, in fifteen days, the islands of Tristan       d’Acunha, in latitude 37 degrees 8’ S, longitude 12 degrees 8’ W.        This group, now so well known, and which consists of three       circular islands, was first discovered by the Portuguese, and was       visited afterward by the Dutch in 1643, and by the French in       1767. The three islands together form a triangle, and are distant       from each other about ten miles, there being fine open passages       between. The land in all of them is very high, especially in       Tristan d’Acunha, properly so called. This is the largest of the       group, being fifteen miles in circumference, and so elevated that       it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or       ninety miles. A part of the land toward the north rises more than       a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea. A tableland at this       height extends back nearly to the centre of the island, and from       this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of Teneriffe. The       lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size, but       the upper region is barren rock, usually hidden among the clouds,       and covered with snow during the greater part of the year. There       are no shoals or other dangers about the island, the shores being       remarkably bold and the water deep. On the northwestern coast is       a bay, with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can       be easily effected, provided there be a southerly wind. Plenty of       excellent water may here be readily procured; also cod and other       fish may be taken with hook and line.        The next island in point of size, and the most westwardly of the       group, is that called the Inaccessible. Its precise situation is       37 degrees 17’ S. latitude, longitude 12 degrees 24’ W. It is       seven or eight miles in circumference, and on all sides presents       a forbidding and precipitous aspect. Its top is perfectly flat,       and the whole region is sterile, nothing growing upon it except a       few stunted shrubs.        Nightingale Island, the smallest and most southerly, is in       latitude 37 degrees 26’ S., longitude 12 degrees 12’ W. Off its       southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets; a few also of       a similar appearance are seen to the northeast. The ground is       irregular and sterile, and a deep valley partially separates it.        The shores of these islands abound, in the proper season, with       sea lions, sea elephants, the hair and fur seal, together with a       great variety of oceanic birds. Whales are also plenty in their       vicinity. Owing to the ease with which these various animals were       here formerly taken, the group has been much visited since its       discovery. The Dutch and French frequented it at a very early       period. In 1790, Captain Patten, of the ship Industry, of       Philadelphia, made Tristan d’Acunha, where he remained seven       months (from August, 1790, to April, 1791) for the purpose of       collecting sealskins. In this time he gathered no less than five       thousand six hundred, and says that he would have had no       difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks. Upon       his arrival he found no quadrupeds, with the exception of a few       wild goats; the island now abounds with all our most valuable       domestic animals, which have been introduced by subsequent       navigators.        I believe it was not long after Captain Patten’s visit that       Captain Colquhoun, of the American brig Betsey, touched at the       largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment. He planted       onions, potatoes, cabbages, and a great many other vegetables, an       abundance of all which is now to be met with.        In 1811, a Captain Haywood, in the Nereus, visited Tristan. He       found there three Americans, who were residing upon the island to       prepare sealskins and oil. One of these men was named Jonathan       Lambert, and he called himself the sovereign of the country. He       had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land, and turned       his attention to raising the coffee-plant and sugar-cane, with       which he had been furnished by the American Minister at Rio       Janeiro. This settlement, however, was finally abandoned, and in       1817 the islands were taken possession of by the British       Government, who sent a detachment for that purpose from the Cape       of Good Hope. They did not, however, retain them long; but, upon       the evacuation of the country as a British possession, two or       three English families took up their residence there       independently of the Government. On the twenty-fifth of March,       1824, the Berwick, Captain Jeffrey, from London to Van Diemen’s       Land, arrived at the place, where they found an Englishman of the       name of Glass, formerly a corporal in the British artillery. He       claimed to be supreme governor of the islands, and had under his       control twenty-one men and three women. He gave a very favourable       account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness       of the soil. The population occupied themselves chiefly in       collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil, with which they traded       to the Cape of Good Hope, Glass owning a small schooner. At the       period of our arrival the governor was still a resident, but his       little community had multiplied, there being fifty-six persons       upon Tristan, besides a smaller settlement of seven on       Nightingale Island. We had no difficulty in procuring almost       every kind of refreshment which we required—sheep, hogs,       bullocks, rabbits, poultry, goats, fish in great variety, and       vegetables were abundant. Having come to anchor close in with the       large island, in eighteen fathoms, we took all we wanted on board       very conveniently. Captain Guy also purchased of Glass five       hundred sealskins and some ivory. We remained here a week, during       which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward,       and the weather somewhat hazy. On the fifth of November we made       sail to the southward and westward, with the intention of having       a thorough search for a group of islands called the Auroras,       respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has       existed.        These islands are said to have been discovered as early as 1762,       by the commander of the ship Aurora. In 1790, Captain Manuel de       Oyarvido, in the ship Princess, belonging to the Royal Philippine       Company, sailed, as he asserts, directly among them. In 1794, the       Spanish corvette Atrevida went with the determination of       ascertaining their precise situation, and, in a paper published       by the Royal Hydrographical Society of Madrid in the year 1809,       the following language is used respecting this expedition: “The       corvette Atrevida practised, in their immediate vicinity, from       the twenty-first to the twenty-seventh of January, all the       necessary observations, and measured by chronometers the       difference of longitude between these islands and the port of       Soledad in the Manillas. The islands are three, they are very       nearly in the same meridian; the centre one is rather low, and       the other two may be seen at nine leagues’ distance.” The       observations made on board the Atrevida give the following       results as the precise situation of each island. The most       northern is in latitude 52 degrees 37’ 24” S., longitude 47       degrees, 43’ 15” W.; the middle one in latitude 53 degrees 2’ 40”       S., longitude 47 degrees 55’ 15” W.; and the most southern in       latitude 53 degrees 15’ 22” S., longitude 47 degrees 57’ 15” W.        On the twenty-seventh of January, 1820, Captain James Weddel, of       the British navy, sailed from Staten Land also in search of the       Auroras. He reports that, having made the most diligent search       and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the       commander of the Atrevida, but in every direction throughout the       vicinity of these spots, he could discover no indication of land.       These conflicting statements have induced other navigators to       look out for the islands; and, strange to say, while some have       sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie       without finding them, there have been not a few who declare       positively that they have seen them; and even been close in with       their shores. It was Captain Guy’s intention to make every       exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in       dispute. {*3}        We kept on our course, between the south and west, with variable       weather, until the twentieth of the month, when we found       ourselves on the debated ground, being in latitude 53 degrees 15’       S., longitude 47 degrees 58’ W.—that is to say, very nearly upon       the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the       group. Not perceiving any sign of land, we continued to the       westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south, as far as       the meridian of fifty degrees west. We then stood to the north as       far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south, when we turned to       the eastward, and kept our parallel by double altitudes, morning       and evening, and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon.       Having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast       of Georgia, we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude       from which we set out. We then took diagonal courses throughout       the entire extent of sea circumscribed, keeping a lookout       constantly at the masthead, and repeating our examination with       the greatest care for a period of three weeks, during which the       weather was remarkably pleasant and fair, with no haze       whatsoever. Of course we were thoroughly satisfied that, whatever       islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period,       no vestige of them remained at the present day. Since my return       home I find that the same ground was traced over, with equal       care, in 1822, by Captain Johnson, of the American schooner       Henry, and by Captain Morrell in the American schooner Wasp—in       both cases with the same result as in our own.     CHAPTER 16         It had been Captain Guy’s original intention, after satisfying       himself about the Auroras, to proceed through the Strait of       Magellan, and up along the western coast of Patagonia; but       information received at Tristan d’Acunha induced him to steer to       the southward, in the hope of falling in with some small islands       said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees S., longitude 41       degrees 20’ W. In the event of his not discovering these lands,       he designed, should the season prove favourable, to push on       toward the pole. Accordingly, on the twelfth of December, we made       sail in that direction. On the eighteenth we found ourselves       about the station indicated by Glass, and cruised for three days       in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he       had mentioned. On the twenty-first, the weather being unusually       pleasant, we again made sail to the southward, with the       resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible.       Before entering upon this portion of my narrative, it may be as       well, for the information of those readers who have paid little       attention to the progress of discovery in these regions, to give       some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the       southern pole which have hitherto been made.        That of Captain Cook was the first of which we have any distinct       account. In 1772 he sailed to the south in the Resolution,       accompanied by Lieutenant Furneaux in the Adventure. In December       he found himself as far as the fifty-eighth parallel of south       latitude, and in longitude 26 degrees 57’ E. Here he met with       narrow fields of ice, about eight or ten inches thick, and       running northwest and southeast. This ice was in large cakes, and       usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great       difficulty in forcing a passage. At this period Captain Cook       supposed, from the vast number of birds to be seen, and from       other indications, that he was in the near vicinity of land. He       kept on to the southward, the weather being exceedingly cold,       until he reached the sixty-fourth parallel, in longitude 38       degrees 14’ E. Here he had mild weather, with gentle breezes, for       five days, the thermometer being at thirty-six. In January, 1773,       the vessels crossed the Antarctic circle, but did not succeed in       penetrating much farther; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees       15’ they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of       ice, extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye       could reach. This ice was of every variety—and some large floes       of it, miles in extent, formed a compact mass, rising eighteen or       twenty feet above the water. It being late in the season, and no       hope entertained of rounding these obstructions, Captain Cook now       reluctantly turned to the northward.        In the November following he renewed his search in the Antarctic.       In latitude 59 degrees 40’ he met with a strong current setting       to the southward. In December, when the vessels were in latitude       67 degrees 31’, longitude 142 degrees 54’ W., the cold was       excessive, with heavy gales and fog. Here also birds were       abundant; the albatross, the penguin, and the peterel especially.       In latitude 70 degrees 23’ some large islands of ice were       encountered, and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward       were observed to be of a snowy whiteness, indicating the vicinity       of field ice. In latitude 71 degrees 10’, longitude 106 degrees       54’ W., the navigators were stopped, as before, by an immense       frozen expanse, which filled the whole area of the southern       horizon. The northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken,       so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible, and       extending about a mile to the southward. Behind it the frozen       surface was comparatively smooth for some distance, until       terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice       mountains, the one towering above the other. Captain Cook       concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was       joined to a continent. Mr. J. N. Reynolds, whose great exertions       and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot       a national expedition, partly for the purpose of exploring these       regions, thus speaks of the attempt of the Resolution. “We are       not surprised that Captain Cook was unable to go beyond 71       degrees 10’, but we are astonished that he did attain that point       on the meridian of 106 degrees 54’ west longitude. Palmer’s Land       lies south of the Shetland, latitude sixty-four degrees, and       tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator       has yet penetrated. Cook was standing for this land when his       progress was arrested by the ice; which, we apprehend, must       always be the case in that point, and so early in the season as       the sixth of January—and we should not be surprised if a portion       of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of       Palmer’s Land, or to some other portions of land lying farther to       the southward and westward.”        In 1803, Captains Kreutzenstern and Lisiausky were dispatched by       Alexander of Russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the       globe. In endeavouring to get south, they made no farther than 59       degrees 58’, in longitude 70 degrees 15’ W. They here met with       strong currents setting eastwardly. Whales were abundant, but       they saw no ice. In regard to this voyage, Mr. Reynolds observes       that, if Kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the       season, he must have encountered ice—it was March when he reached       the latitude specified. The winds, prevailing, as they do, from       the southward and westward, had carried the floes, aided by       currents, into that icy region bounded on the north by Georgia,       east by Sandwich Land and the South Orkneys, and west by the       South Shetland islands.        In 1822, Captain James Weddell, of the British navy, with two       very small vessels, penetrated farther to the south than any       previous navigator, and this, too, without encountering       extraordinary difficulties. He states that although he was       frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventy-second       parallel, yet, upon attaining it, not a particle was to be       discovered, and that, upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees       15’, no fields, and only three islands of ice were visible. It is       somewhat remarkable that, although vast flocks of birds were       seen, and other usual indications of land, and although, south of       the Shetlands, unknown coasts were observed from the masthead       tending southwardly, Weddell discourages the idea of land       existing in the polar regions of the south.        On the 11th of January, 1823, Captain Benjamin Morrell, of the       American schooner Wasp, sailed from Kerguelen’s Land with a view       of penetrating as far south as possible. On the first of February       he found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52’ S., longitude 118       degrees 27’ E. The following passage is extracted from his       journal of that date. “The wind soon freshened to an eleven-knot       breeze, and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west;       being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond       latitude sixty-four degrees, the less ice was to be apprehended,       we steered a little to the southward, until we crossed the       Antarctic circle, and were in latitude 69 degrees 15’ E. In this       latitude there was no field ice, and very few ice islands in       sight.”        Under the date of March fourteenth I find also this entry. “The       sea was now entirely free of field ice, and there were not more       than a dozen ice islands in sight. At the same time the       temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees       higher (more mild) than we had ever found it between the       parallels of sixty and sixty-two south. We were now in latitude       70 degrees 14’ S., and the temperature of the air was       forty-seven, and that of the water forty-four. In this situation       I found the variation to be 14 degrees 27’ easterly, per       azimuth.... I have several times passed within the Antarctic       circle, on different meridians, and have uniformly found the       temperature, both of the air and the water, to become more and       more mild the farther I advanced beyond the sixty-fifth degree of       south latitude, and that the variation decreases in the same       proportion. While north of this latitude, say between sixty and       sixty-five south, we frequently had great difficulty in finding a       passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable       ice islands, some of which were from one to two miles in       circumference, and more than five hundred feet above the surface       of the water.”        Being nearly destitute of fuel and water, and without proper       instruments, it being also late in the season, Captain Morrell       was now obliged to put back, without attempting any further       progress to the westward, although an entirely open, sea lay       before him. He expresses the opinion that, had not these       overruling considerations obliged him to retreat, he could have       penetrated, if not to the pole itself, at least to the       eighty-fifth parallel. I have given his ideas respecting these       matters somewhat at length, that the reader may have an       opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own       subsequent experience.        In 1831, Captain Briscoe, in the employ of the Messieurs Enderby,       whale-ship owners of London, sailed in the brig Lively for the       South Seas, accompanied by the cutter Tula. On the twenty-eighth       of February, being in latitude 66 degrees 30’ S., longitude 47       degrees 31’ E., he descried land, and “clearly discovered through       the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running E. S.       E.” He remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the       following month, but was unable to approach the coast nearer than       within ten leagues, owing to the boisterous state of the weather.       Finding it impossible to make further discovery during this       season, he returned northward to winter in Van Diemen’s Land.        In the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded southwardly, and on       the fourth of February land was seen to the southeast in latitude       67 degrees 15’ longitude 69 degrees 29’ W. This was soon found to       be an island near the headland of the country he had first       discovered. On the twenty-first of the month he succeeded in       landing on the latter, and took possession of it in the name of       William IV, calling it Adelaide’s Island, in honour of the       English queen. These particulars being made known to the Royal       Geographical Society of London, the conclusion was drawn by that       body “that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47       degrees 30’ E. to 69 degrees 29’ W. longitude, running the       parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south       latitude.” In respect to this conclusion Mr. Reynolds observes:       “In the correctness of it we by no means concur; nor do the       discoveries of Briscoe warrant any such indifference. It was       within these limits that Weddel proceeded south on a meridian to       the east of Georgia, Sandwich Land, and the South Orkney and       Shetland islands.” My own experience will be found to testify       most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the       society.        These are the principal attempts which have been made at       penetrating to a high southern latitude, and it will now be seen       that there remained, previous to the voyage of the Jane, nearly       three hundred degrees of longitude in which the Antarctic circle       had not been crossed at all. Of course a wide field lay before us       for discovery, and it was with feelings of most intense interest       that I heard Captain Guy express his resolution of pushing boldly       to the southward.     CHAPTER 17         We kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the       search for Glass’s islands, without meeting with any ice at all.       On the twenty-sixth, at noon, we were in latitude 63 degrees 23’       S., longitude 41 degrees 25’ W. We now saw several large ice       islands, and a floe of field ice, not, however, of any great       extent. The winds generally blew from the southeast, or the       northeast, but were very light. Whenever we had a westerly wind,       which was seldom, it was invariably attended with a rain squall.       Every day we had more or less snow. The thermometer, on the       twenty-seventh stood at thirty-five.        January 1, 1828.—This day we found ourselves completely hemmed in       by the ice, and our prospects looked cheerless indeed. A strong       gale blew, during the whole forenoon, from the northeast, and       drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter       with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences.       Toward evening, the gale still blowing with fury, a large field       in front separated, and we were enabled, by carrying a press of       sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open       water beyond. As we approached this space we took in sail by       degrees, and having at length got clear, lay-to under a single       reefed foresail.        January 2.—We had now tolerably pleasant weather. At noon we       found ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10’ S, longitude 42       degrees 20’ W, having crossed the Antarctic circle. Very little       ice was to be seen to the southward, although large fields of it       lay behind us. This day we rigged some sounding gear, using a       large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons, and a line of       two hundred fathoms. We found the current setting to the north,       about a quarter of a mile per hour. The temperature of the air       was now about thirty-three. Here we found the variation to be 14       degrees 28’ easterly, per azimuth.        January 5.—We had still held on to the southward without any very       great impediments. On this morning, however, being in latitude 73       degrees 15’ E., longitude 42 degrees 10’ W, we were again brought       to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice. We saw,       nevertheless, much open water to the southward, and felt no doubt       of being able to reach it eventually. Standing to the eastward       along the edge of the floe, we at length came to a passage of       about a mile in width, through which we warped our way by       sundown. The sea in which we now were was thickly covered with       ice islands, but had no field ice, and we pushed on boldly as       before. The cold did not seem to increase, although we had snow       very frequently, and now and then hail squalls of great violence.       Immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day,       going from southeast to northwest.        January 7.—The sea still remained pretty well open, so that we       had no difficulty in holding on our course. To the westward we       saw some icebergs of incredible size, and in the afternoon passed       very near one whose summit could not have been less than four       hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean. Its girth was       probably, at the base, three-quarters of a league, and several       streams of water were running from crevices in its sides. We       remained in sight of this island two days, and then only lost it       in a fog.        January 10.—Early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a       man overboard. He was an American named Peter Vredenburgh, a       native of New York, and was one of the most valuable hands on       board the schooner. In going over the bows his foot slipped, and       he fell between two cakes of ice, never rising again. At noon of       this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30’, longitude 40 degrees       15’ W. The cold was now excessive, and we had hail squalls       continually from the northward and eastward. In this direction       also we saw several more immense icebergs, and the whole horizon       to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice, rising       in tiers, one mass above the other. Some driftwood floated by       during the evening, and a great quantity of birds flew over,       among which were nellies, peterels, albatrosses, and a large bird       of a brilliant blue plumage. The variation here, per azimuth, was       less than it had been previously to our passing the Antarctic       circle.        January 12.—Our passage to the south again looked doubtful, as       nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one       apparently limitless floe, backed by absolute mountains of ragged       ice, one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other. We       stood to the westward until the fourteenth, in the hope of       finding an entrance.        January 14.—This morning we reached the western extremity of the       field which had impeded us, and, weathering it, came to an open       sea, without a particle of ice. Upon sounding with two hundred       fathoms, we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate       of half a mile per hour. The temperature of the air was       forty-seven, that of the water thirty-four. We now sailed to the       southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the       sixteenth, when, at noon, we were in latitude 81 degrees 21’,       longitude 42 degrees W. We here again sounded, and found a       current setting still southwardly, and at the rate of three       quarters of a mile per hour. The variation per azimuth had       diminished, and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant,       the thermometer being as high as fifty-one. At this period not a       particle of ice was to be discovered. All hands on board now felt       certain of attaining the pole.        January 17.—This day was full of incident. Innumerable flights of       birds flew over us from the southward, and several were shot from       the deck, one of them, a species of pelican, proved to be       excellent eating. About midday a small floe of ice was seen from       the masthead off the larboard bow, and upon it there appeared to       be some large animal. As the weather was good and nearly calm,       Captain Guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was. Dirk       Peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat. Upon       coming up with the floe, we perceived that it was in the       possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the Arctic bear,       but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals. Being       well armed, we made no scruple of attacking it at once. Several       shots were fired in quick succession, the most of which took       effect, apparently, in the head and body. Nothing discouraged,       however, the monster threw himself from the ice, and swam with       open jaws, to the boat in which were Peters and myself. Owing to       the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of       the adventure, no person was ready immediately with a second       shot, and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his       vast bulk across our gunwale, and seizing one of the men by the       small of his back, before any efficient means were taken to repel       him. In this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of       Peters saved us from destruction. Leaping upon the back of the       huge beast, he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck,       reaching the spinal marrow at a blow. The brute tumbled into the       sea lifeless, and without a struggle, rolling over Peters as he       fell. The latter soon recovered himself, and a rope being thrown       him, he secured the carcass before entering the boat. We then       returned in triumph to the schooner, towing our trophy behind us.       This bear, upon admeasurement, proved to be full fifteen feet in       his greatest length. His wool was perfectly white, and very       coarse, curling tightly. The eyes were of a blood red, and larger       than those of the Arctic bear, the snout also more rounded,       rather resembling the snout of the bulldog. The meat was tender,       but excessively rank and fishy, although the men devoured it with       avidity, and declared it excellent eating.        Scarcely had we got our prize alongside, when the man at the       masthead gave the joyful shout of “land on the starboard bow!”       All hands were now upon the alert, and, a breeze springing up       very opportunely from the northward and eastward, we were soon       close in with the coast. It proved to be a low rocky islet, of       about a league in circumference, and altogether destitute of       vegetation, if we except a species of prickly pear. In       approaching it from the northward, a singular ledge of rock is       seen projecting into the sea, and bearing a strong resemblance to       corded bales of cotton. Around this ledge to the westward is a       small bay, at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient       landing.        It did not take us long to explore every portion of the island,       but, with one exception, we found nothing worthy of our       observation. In the southern extremity, we picked up near the       shore, half buried in a pile of loose stones, a piece of wood,       which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe. There had been       evidently some attempt at carving upon it, and Captain Guy       fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise, but the       resemblance did not strike me very forcibly. Besides this prow,       if such it were, we found no other token that any living creature       had ever been here before. Around the coast we discovered       occasional small floes of ice—but these were very few. The exact       situation of the islet (to which Captain Guy gave the name of       Bennet’s Islet, in honour of his partner in the ownership of the       schooner) is 82 degrees 50’ S. latitude, 42 degrees 20’ W.       longitude.        We had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees       farther than any previous navigators, and the sea still lay       perfectly open before us. We found, too, that the variation       uniformly decreased as we proceeded, and, what was still more       surprising, that the temperature of the air, and latterly of the       water, became milder. The weather might even be called pleasant,       and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some       northern point of the compass. The sky was usually clear, with       now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern       horizon—this, however, was invariably of brief duration. Two       difficulties alone presented themselves to our view; we were       getting short of fuel, and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among       several of the crew. These considerations began to impress upon       Captain Guy the necessity of returning, and he spoke of it       frequently. For my own part, confident as I was of soon arriving       at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing, and       having every reason to believe, from present appearances, that we       should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher Arctic       latitudes, I warmly pressed upon him the expediency of       persevering, at least for a few days longer, in the direction we       were now holding. So tempting an opportunity of solving the great       problem in regard to an Antarctic continent had never yet been       afforded to man, and I confess that I felt myself bursting with       indignation at the timid and ill-timed suggestions of our       commander. I believe, indeed, that what I could not refrain from       saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push       on. While, therefore, I cannot but lament the most unfortunate       and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice, I must       still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having       been instrumental, however remotely, in opening to the eye of       science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever       engrossed its attention.     CHAPTER 18         January 18.—This morning {*4} we continued to the southward, with       the same pleasant weather as before. The sea was entirely smooth,       the air tolerably warm and from the northeast, the temperature of       the water fifty-three. We now again got our sounding-gear in       order, and, with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line, found the       current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour.       This constant tendency to the southward, both in the wind and       current, caused some degree of speculation, and even of alarm, in       different quarters of the schooner, and I saw distinctly that no       little impression had been made upon the mind of Captain Guy. He       was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule, however, and I finally       succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions. The variation       was now very trivial. In the course of the day we saw several       large whales of the right species, and innumerable flights of the       albatross passed over the vessel. We also picked up a bush, full       of red berries, like those of the hawthorn, and the carcass of a       singular-looking land-animal. It was three feet in length, and       but six inches in height, with four very short legs, the feet       armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet, and resembling       coral in substance. The body was covered with a straight silky       hair, perfectly white. The tail was peaked like that of a rat,       and about a foot and a half long. The head resembled a cat’s,       with the exception of the ears—these were flopped like the ears       of a dog. The teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the       claws.        January 19.—To-day, being in latitude 83 degrees 20’, longitude       43 degrees 5’ W. (the sea being of an extraordinarily dark       colour), we again saw land from the masthead, and, upon a closer       scrutiny, found it to be one of a group of very large islands.       The shore was precipitous, and the interior seemed to be well       wooded, a circumstance which occasioned us great joy. In about       four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor       in ten fathoms, sandy bottom, a league from the coast, as a high       surf, with strong ripples here and there, rendered a nearer       approach of doubtful expediency. The two largest boats were now       ordered out, and a party, well armed (among whom were Peters and       myself), proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which       appeared to encircle the island. After searching about for some       time, we discovered an inlet, which we were entering, when we saw       four large canoes put off from the shore, filled with men who       seemed to be well armed. We waited for them to come up, and, as       they moved with great rapidity, they were soon within hail.       Captain Guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an       oar, when the strangers made a full stop, and commenced a loud       jabbering all at once, intermingled with occasional shouts, in       which we could distinguish the words Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama!       They continued this for at least half an hour, during which we       had a good opportunity of observing their appearance.        In the four canoes, which might have been fifty feet long and       five broad, there were a hundred and ten savages in all. They       were about the ordinary stature of Europeans, but of a more       muscular and brawny frame. Their complexion a jet black, with       thick and long woolly hair. They were clothed in skins of an       unknown black animal, shaggy and silky, and made to fit the body       with some degree of skill, the hair being inside, except where       turned out about the neck, wrists, and ankles. Their arms       consisted principally of clubs, of a dark, and apparently very       heavy wood. Some spears, however, were observed among them,       headed with flint, and a few slings. The bottoms of the canoes       were full of black stones about the size of a large egg.        When they had concluded their harangue (for it was clear they       intended their jabbering for such), one of them who seemed to be       the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe, and made signs for       us to bring our boats alongside of him. This hint we pretended       not to understand, thinking it the wiser plan to maintain, if       possible, the interval between us, as their number more than       quadrupled our own. Finding this to be the case, the chief       ordered the three other canoes to hold back, while he advanced       toward us with his own. As soon as he came up with us he leaped       on board the largest of our boats, and seated himself by the side       of Captain Guy, pointing at the same time to the schooner, and       repeating the word Anamoo-moo! and Lama-Lama! We now put back to       the vessel, the four canoes following at a little distance.        Upon getting alongside, the chief evinced symptoms of extreme       surprise and delight, clapping his hands, slapping his thighs and       breast, and laughing obstreperously. His followers behind joined       in his merriment, and for some minutes the din was so excessive       as to be absolutely deafening. Quiet being at length restored,       Captain Guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up, as a necessary       precaution, and gave the chief (whose name we soon found to be       Too-wit) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of       his men on deck at one time. With this arrangement he appeared       perfectly satisfied, and gave some directions to the canoes, when       one of them approached, the rest remaining about fifty yards off.       Twenty of the savages now got on board, and proceeded to ramble       over every part of the deck, and scramble about among the       rigging, making themselves much at home, and examining every       article with great inquisitiveness.        It was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the       white race—from whose complexion, indeed, they appeared to       recoil. They believed the Jane to be a living creature, and       seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their       spears, carefully turning them up. Our crew were much amused with       the conduct of Too-wit in one instance. The cook was splitting       some wood near the galley, and, by accident, struck his axe into       the deck, making a gash of considerable depth. The chief       immediately ran up, and pushing the cook on one side rather       roughly, commenced a half whine, half howl, strongly indicative       of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner,       patting and smoothing the gash with his hand, and washing it from       a bucket of seawater which stood by. This was a degree of       ignorance for which we were not prepared, and for my part I could       not help thinking some of it affected.        When the visitors had satisfied, as well as they could, their       curiosity in regard to our upper works, they were admitted below,       when their amazement exceeded all bounds. Their astonishment now       appeared to be far too deep for words, for they roamed about in       silence, broken only by low ejaculations. The arms afforded them       much food for speculation, and they were suffered to handle and       examine them at leisure. I do not believe that they had the least       suspicion of their actual use, but rather took them for idols,       seeing the care we had of them, and the attention with which we       watched their movements while handling them. At the great guns       their wonder was redoubled. They approached them with every mark       of the profoundest reverence and awe, but forbore to examine them       minutely. There were two large mirrors in the cabin, and here was       the acme of their amazement. Too-wit was the first to approach       them, and he had got in the middle of the cabin, with his face to       one and his back to the other, before he fairly perceived them.       Upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass,       I thought the savage would go mad; but, upon turning short round       to make a retreat, and beholding himself a second time in the       opposite direction, I was afraid he would expire upon the spot.       No persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look;       throwing himself upon the floor, with his face buried in his       hands, he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon       deck.        The whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner,       twenty at a time, Too-wit being suffered to remain during the       entire period. We saw no disposition to thievery among them, nor       did we miss a single article after their departure. Throughout       the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner.       There were, however, some points in their demeanour which we       found it impossible to understand; for example, we could not get       them to approach several very harmless objects—such as the       schooner’s sails, an egg, an open book, or a pan of flour. We       endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles       which might be turned to account in the way of traffic, but found       great difficulty in being comprehended. We made out,       nevertheless, what greatly astonished us, that the islands       abounded in the large tortoise of the Gallipagos, one of which we       saw in the canoe of Too-wit. We saw also some biche de mer in the       hands of one of the savages, who was greedily devouring it in its       natural state. These anomalies—for they were such when considered       in regard to the latitude—induced Captain Guy to wish for a       thorough investigation of the country, in the hope of making a       profitable speculation in his discovery. For my own part, anxious       as I was to know something more of these islands, I was still       more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward       without delay. We had now fine weather, but there was no telling       how long it would last; and being already in the eighty-fourth       parallel, with an open sea before us, a current setting strongly       to the southward, and the wind fair, I could not listen with any       patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely       necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a       proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions. I represented to the       captain that we might easily make this group on our return, and       winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice. He at       length came into my views (for in some way, hardly known to       myself, I had acquired much influence over him), and it was       finally resolved that, even in the event of our finding biche de       mer, we should only stay here a week to recruit, and then push on       to the southward while we might. Accordingly we made every       necessary preparation, and, under the guidance of Too-wit, got       the Jane through the reef in safety, coming to anchor about a       mile from the shore, in an excellent bay, completely landlocked,       on the southeastern coast of the main island, and in ten fathoms       of water, black sandy bottom. At the head of this bay there were       three fine springs (we were told) of good water, and we saw       abundance of wood in the vicinity. The four canoes followed us       in, keeping, however, at a respectful distance. Too-wit himself       remained on board, and, upon our dropping anchor, invited us to       accompany him on shore, and visit his village in the interior. To       this Captain Guy consented; and ten savages being left on board       as hostages, a party of us, twelve in all, got in readiness to       attend the chief. We took care to be well armed, yet without       evincing any distrust. The schooner had her guns run out, her       boarding-nettings up, and every other proper precaution was taken       to guard against surprise. Directions were left with the chief       mate to admit no person on board during our absence, and, in the       event of our not appearing in twelve hours, to send the cutter,       with a swivel, around the island in search of us.        At every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us       that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto       visited by civilized men. We saw nothing with which we had been       formerly conversant. The trees resembled no growth of either the       torrid, the temperate, or the northern frigid zones, and were       altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had       already traversed. The very rocks were novel in their mass, their       color, and their stratification; and the streams themselves,       utterly incredible as it may appear, had so little in common with       those of other climates, that we were scrupulous of tasting them,       and, indeed, had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that       their qualities were purely those of nature. At a small brook       which crossed our path (the first we had reached) Too-wit and his       attendants halted to drink. On account of the singular character       of the water, we refused to taste it, supposing it to be       polluted; and it was not until some time afterward we came to       understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout       the whole group. I am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the       nature of this liquid, and cannot do so without many words.       Although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common       water would do so, yet never, except when falling in a cascade,       had it the customary appearance of limpidity. It was,       nevertheless, in point of fact, as perfectly limpid as any       limestone water in existence, the difference being only in       appearance. At first sight, and especially in cases where little       declivity was found, it bore resemblance, as regards consistency,       to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water. But this was       only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities. It was       not colourless, nor was it of any one uniform colour—presenting       to the eye, as it flowed, every possible shade of purple; like       the hues of a changeable silk. This variation in shade was       produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in       the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of       Too-wit. Upon collecting a basinful, and allowing it to settle       thoroughly, we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made       up of a number of distinct veins, each of a distinct hue; that       these veins did not commingle; and that their cohesion was       perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves, and       imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins. Upon passing the blade       of a knife athwart the veins, the water closed over it       immediately, as with us, and also, in withdrawing it, all traces       of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated. If,       however, the blade was passed down accurately between the two       veins, a perfect separation was effected, which the power of       cohesion did not immediately rectify. The phenomena of this water       formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent       miracles with which I was destined to be at length encircled.     CHAPTER 19         We were nearly three hours in reaching the village, it being more       than nine miles in the interior, and the path lying through a       rugged country. As we passed along, the party of Too-wit (the       whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes) was momentarily       strengthened by smaller detachments, of from two to six or seven,       which joined us, as if by accident, at different turns of the       road. There appeared so much of system in this that I could not       help feeling distrust, and I spoke to Captain Guy of my       apprehensions. It was now too late, however, to recede, and we       concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect       confidence in the good faith of Too-wit. We accordingly went on,       keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages, and not       permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between. In       this way, passing through a precipitous ravine, we at length       reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations       upon the island. As we came in sight of them, the chief set up a       shout, and frequently repeated the word Klock-klock, which we       supposed to be the name of the village, or perhaps the generic       name for villages.        The dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable,       and, unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with       which mankind are acquainted, were of no uniform plan. Some of       them (and these we found belonged to the Wampoos or Yampoos, the       great men of the land) consisted of a tree cut down at about four       feet from the root, with a large black skin thrown over it, and       hanging in loose folds upon the ground. Under this the savage       nestled. Others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees,       with the withered foliage upon them, made to recline, at an angle       of forty-five degrees, against a bank of clay, heaped up, without       regular form, to the height of five or six feet. Others, again,       were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly, and covered       over with similar branches, these being removed when the tenant       was about to enter, and pulled on again when he had entered. A       few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood, the       upper limbs being partially cut through, so as to bend over upon       the lower, thus forming thicker shelter from the weather. The       greater number, however, consisted of small shallow caverns,       apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark       stone, resembling fuller’s earth, with which three sides of the       village were bounded. At the door of each of these primitive       caverns was a small rock, which the tenant carefully placed       before the entrance upon leaving his residence, for what purpose       I could not ascertain, as the stone itself was never of       sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening.        This village, if it were worthy of the name, lay in a valley of       some depth, and could only be approached from the southward, the       precipitous ledge of which I have already spoken cutting off all       access in other directions. Through the middle of the valley ran       a brawling stream of the same magical-looking water which has       been described. We saw several strange animals about the       dwellings, all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated. The       largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the       structure of the body and snout; the tail, however, was bushy,       and the legs slender as those of the antelope. Its motion was       exceedingly awkward and indecisive, and we never saw it attempt       to run. We noticed also several animals very similar in       appearance, but of a greater length of body, and covered with a       black wool. There were a great variety of tame fowls running       about, and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the       natives. To our astonishment we saw black albatross among these       birds in a state of entire domestication, going to sea       periodically for food, but always returning to the village as a       home, and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of       incubation. There they were joined by their friends the pelicans       as usual, but these latter never followed them to the dwellings       of the savages. Among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks,       differing very little from the canvass-back of our own country,       black gannets, and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in       appearance, but not carnivorous. Of fish there seemed to be a       great abundance. We saw, during our visit, a quantity of dried       salmon, rock cod, blue dolphins, mackerel, blackfish, skate,       conger eels, elephantfish, mullets, soles, parrotfish,       leather-jackets, gurnards, hake, flounders, paracutas, and       innumerable other varieties. We noticed, too, that most of them       were similar to the fish about the group of Lord Auckland       Islands, in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south. The       Gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful. We saw but few wild       animals, and none of a large size, or of a species with which we       were familiar. One or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed       our path, but the natives paid them little attention, and we       concluded that they were not venomous.        As we approached the village with Too-wit and his party, a vast       crowd of the people rushed out to meet us, with loud shouts,       among which we could only distinguish the everlasting Anamoo-moo!       and Lama-Lama! We were much surprised at perceiving that, with       one or two exceptions, these new comers were entirely naked, and       skins being used only by the men of the canoes. All the weapons       of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter,       for there was no appearance of any among the villagers. There       were a great many women and children, the former not altogether       wanting in what might be termed personal beauty. They were       straight, tall, and well formed, with a grace and freedom of       carriage not to be found in civilized society. Their lips,       however, like those of the men, were thick and clumsy, so that,       even when laughing, the teeth were never disclosed. Their hair       was of a finer texture than that of the males. Among these naked       villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed,       like the party of Too-wit, in dresses of black skin, and armed       with lances and heavy clubs. These appeared to have great       influence among the rest, and were always addressed by the title       Wampoo. These, too, were the tenants of the black skin palaces.       That of Too-wit was situated in the centre of the village, and       was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of       its kind. The tree which formed its support was cut off at a       distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root, and there       were several branches left just below the cut, these serving to       extend the covering, and in this way prevent its flapping about       the trunk. The covering, too, which consisted of four very large       skins fastened together with wooden skewers, was secured at the       bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground. The floor       was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet.        To this hut we were conducted with great solemnity, and as many       of the natives crowded in after us as possible. Too-wit seated       himself on the leaves, and made signs that we should follow his       example. This we did, and presently found ourselves in a       situation peculiarly uncomfortable, if not indeed critical. We       were on the ground, twelve in number, with the savages, as many       as forty, sitting on their hams so closely around us that, if any       disturbance had arisen, we should have found it impossible to       make use of our arms, or indeed to have risen to our feet. The       pressure was not only inside the tent, but outside, where       probably was every individual on the whole island, the crowd       being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant       exertions and vociferations of Too-wit. Our chief security lay,       however, in the presence of Too-wit himself among us, and we       resolved to stick by him closely, as the best chance of       extricating ourselves from the dilemma, sacrificing him       immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design.        After some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored, when       the chief addressed us in a speech of great length, and very       nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes, with the       exception that the Anamoo-moos! were now somewhat more       strenuously insisted upon than the Lama-Lamas! We listened in       profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue, when       Captain Guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal       friendship and goodwill, concluding what he had to say by a       present of several strings of blue beads and a knife. At the       former the monarch, much to our surprise, turned up his nose with       some expression of contempt, but the knife gave him the most       unlimited satisfaction, and he immediately ordered dinner. This       was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants, and       consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown       animal, probably one of the slim-legged hogs which we had       observed in our approach to the village. Seeing us at a loss how       to proceed, he began, by way of setting us an example, to devour       yard after yard of the enticing food, until we could positively       stand it no longer, and evinced such manifest symptoms of       rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of       astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the       looking-glasses. We declined, however, partaking of the       delicacies before us, and endeavoured to make him understand that       we had no appetite whatever, having just finished a hearty       dejeuner.        When the monarch had made an end of his meal, we commenced a       series of cross-questioning in every ingenious manner we could       devise, with a view of discovering what were the chief       productions of the country, and whether any of them might be       turned to profit. At length he seemed to have some idea of our       meaning, and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he       assured us the biche de mer (pointing to a specimen of that       animal) was to be found in great abundance. We were glad of this       early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd,       and signified our eagerness to proceed. We now left the tent,       and, accompanied by the whole population of the village, followed       the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island, nor far       from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor. We waited here for       about an hour, until the four canoes were brought around by some       of the savages to our station. The whole of our party then       getting into one of them, we were paddled along the edge of the       reef before mentioned, and of another still farther out, where we       saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen       among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes       most celebrated for this article of commerce. We stayed near       these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could       easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary, when we       were taken alongside the schooner, and parted with Too-wit, after       obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us, in the       course of twenty-four hours, as many of the canvass-back ducks       and Gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold. In the whole of       this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives       calculated to create suspicion, with the single exception of the       systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during       our route from the schooner to the village.     CHAPTER 20         The chief was as good as his word, and we were soon plentifully       supplied with fresh provisions. We found the tortoises as fine as       we had ever seen, and the ducks surpassed our best species of       wild fowl, being exceedingly tender, juicy, and well-flavoured.       Besides these, the savages brought us, upon our making them       comprehend our wishes, a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy       grass, with a canoe-load of fresh fish and some dried. The celery       was a treat indeed, and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable       benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of       disease. In a very short time we had not a single person on the       sick-list. We had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions,       among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling       the mussel in shape, but with the taste of an oyster. Shrimps,       too, and prawns were abundant, and albatross and other birds’       eggs with dark shells. We took in, too, a plentiful stock of the       flesh of the hog which I have mentioned before. Most of the men       found it a palatable food, but I thought it fishy and otherwise       disagreeable. In return for these good things we presented the       natives with blue beads, brass trinkets, nails, knives, and       pieces of red cloth, they being fully delighted in the exchange.       We established a regular market on shore, just under the guns of       the schooner, where our barterings were carried on with every       appearance of good faith, and a degree of order which their       conduct at the village of _Klock-klock_ had not led us to expect       from the savages.        Matters went on thus very amicably for several days, during which       parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner, and       parties of our men frequently on shore, making long excursions       into the interior, and receiving no molestation whatever. Finding       the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with _biche de       mer_, owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders, and the       readiness with which they would render us assistance in       collecting it, Captain Guy resolved to enter into negotiations       with Too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure       the article, and for the services of himself and tribe in       gathering as much as possible, while he himself took advantage of       the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward. Upon       mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to       enter into an agreement. A bargain was accordingly struck,       perfectly satisfactory to both parties, by which it was arranged       that, after making the necessary preparations, such as laying off       the proper grounds, erecting a portion of the buildings, and       doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be       required, the schooner should proceed on her route, leaving three       of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the       project, and instruct the natives in drying the _biche de mer_.       In regard to terms, these were made to depend upon the exertions       of the savages in our absence. They were to receive a stipulated       quantity of blue beads, knives, red cloth, and so forth, for       every certain number of piculs of the _biche de mer_ which should       be ready on our return.        A description of the nature of this important article of       commerce, and the method of preparing it, may prove of some       interest to my readers, and I can find no more suitable place       than this for introducing an account of it. The following       comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern       history of a voyage to the South Seas.        “It is that _mollusca_ from the Indian Seas which is known to       commerce by the French name _bouche de mer_ (a nice morsel from       the sea). If I am not much mistaken, the celebrated Cuvier calls       it _gasteropeda pulmonifera_. It is abundantly gathered in the       coasts of the Pacific islands, and gathered especially for the       Chinese market, where it commands a great price, perhaps as much       as their much-talked-of edible birds’ nests, which are properly       made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of       swallow from the body of these molluscae. They have no shell, no       legs, nor any prominent part, except an _absorbing_ and an       _excretory_, opposite organs; but, by their elastic wings, like       caterpillars or worms, they creep in shallow waters, in which,       when low, they can be seen by a kind of swallow, the sharp bill       of which, inserted in the soft animal, draws a gummy and       filamentous substance, which, by drying, can be wrought into the       solid walls of their nest. Hence the name of _gasteropeda       pulmonifera_.        “This mollusca is oblong, and of different sizes, from three to       eighteen inches in length; and I have seen a few that were not       less than two feet long. They were nearly round, a little       flattish on one side, which lies next to the bottom of the sea;       and they are from one to eight inches thick. They crawl up into       shallow water at particular seasons of the year, probably for the       purpose of gendering, as we often find them in pairs. It is when       the sun has the most power on the water, rendering it tepid, that       they approach the shore; and they often go up into places so       shallow that, on the tide’s receding, they are left dry, exposed       to the beat of the sun. But they do not bring forth their young       in shallow water, as we never see any of their progeny, and       full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water.       They feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce       the coral.        “The _biche de mer_ is generally taken in three or four feet of       water; after which they are brought on shore, and split at one       end with a knife, the incision being one inch or more, according       to the size of the mollusca. Through this opening the entrails       are forced out by pressure, and they are much like those of any       other small tenant of the deep. The article is then washed, and       afterward boiled to a certain degree, which must not be too much       or too little. They are then buried in the ground for four hours,       then boiled again for a short time, after which they are dried,       either by the fire or the sun. Those cured by the sun are worth       the most; but where one picul (133 1/3 lbs.) can be cured that       way, I can cure thirty piculs by the fire. When once properly       cured, they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years       without any risk; but they should be examined once in every few       months, say four times a year, to see if any dampness is likely       to affect them.        “The Chinese, as before stated, consider _biche de mer_ a very       great luxury, believing that it wonderfully strengthens and       nourishes the system, and renews the exhausted system of the       immoderate voluptuary. The first quality commands a high price in       Canton, being worth ninety dollars a picul; the second quality,       seventy-five dollars; the third, fifty dollars; the fourth,       thirty dollars; the fifth, twenty dollars; the sixth, twelve       dollars; the seventh, eight dollars; and the eighth, four       dollars; small cargoes, however, will often bring more in       Manilla, Singapore, and Batavia.”        An agreement having been thus entered into, we proceeded       immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the       buildings and clearing the ground. A large flat space near the       eastern shore of the bay was selected, where there was plenty of       both wood and water, and within a convenient distance of the       principal reefs on which the _biche de mer_ was to be procured.       We now all set to work in good earnest, and soon, to the great       astonishment of the savages, had felled a sufficient number of       trees for our purpose, getting them quickly in order for the       framework of the houses, which in two or three days were so far       under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the       three men whom we intended to leave behind. These were John       Carson, Alfred Harris, and ___ Peterson (all natives of London, I       believe), who volunteered their services in this respect.        By the last of the month we had everything in readiness for       departure. We had agreed, however, to pay a formal visit of       leave-taking to the village, and Too-wit insisted so       pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think       it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal.       I believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest       suspicion of the good faith of the savages. They had uniformly       behaved with the greatest decorum, aiding us with alacrity in our       work, offering us their commodities, frequently without price,       and never, in any instance, pilfering a single article, although       the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident       by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon       our making them a present. The women especially were most       obliging in every respect, and, upon the whole, we should have       been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a       single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us       so well. A very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent       kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan       for our destruction, and that the islanders for whom we       entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem, were among the       most barbarous, subtle, and bloodthirsty wretches that ever       contaminated the face of the globe.        It was on the first of February that we went on shore for the       purpose of visiting the village. Although, as said before, we       entertained not the slightest suspicion, still no proper       precaution was neglected. Six men were left in the schooner, with       instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel       during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain       constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were up, the guns       double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded       with canisters of musket-balls. She lay, with her anchor apeak,       about a mile from the shore, and no canoe could approach her in       any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the       full fire of our swivels immediately.        The six men being left on board, our shore-party consisted of       thirty-two persons in all. We were armed to the teeth, having       with us muskets, pistols, and cutlasses; besides, each had a long       kind of seaman’s knife, somewhat resembling the bowie knife now       so much used throughout our western and southern country. A       hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the       purpose of accompanying us on our way. We noticed, however, with       some surprise, that they were now entirely without arms; and,       upon questioning Too-wit in relation to this circumstance, he       merely answered that _Mattee non we pa pa si_—meaning that there       was no need of arms where all were brothers. We took this in good       part, and proceeded.        We had passed the spring and rivulet of which I before spoke, and       were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain       of soapstone hills among which the village was situated. This       gorge was very rocky and uneven, so much so that it was with no       little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to       Klock-klock. The whole length of the ravine might have been a       mile and a half, or probably two miles. It wound in every       possible direction through the hills (having apparently formed,       at some remote period, the bed of a torrent), in no instance       proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn. The       sides of this dell would have averaged, I am sure, seventy or       eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of       their extent, and in some portions they arose to an astonishing       height, overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of       the light of day could penetrate. The general width was about       forty feet, and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the       passage of more than five or six persons abreast. In short, there       could be no place in the world better adapted for the       consummation of an ambuscade, and it was no more than natural       that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it.       When I now think of our egregious folly, the chief subject of       astonishment seems to be, that we should have ever ventured,       under any circumstances, so completely into the power of unknown       savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in       our progress through this ravine. Yet such was the order we       blindly took up, trusting foolishly to the force of our party,       the unarmed condition of Too-wit and his men, the certain       efficacy of our firearms (whose effect was yet a secret to the       natives), and, more than all, to the long-sustained pretension of       friendship kept up by these infamous wretches. Five or six of       them went on before, as if to lead the way, ostentatiously       busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from       the path. Next came our own party. We walked closely together,       taking care only to prevent separation. Behind followed the main       body of the savages, observing unusual order and decorum.        Dirk Peters, a man named Wilson Allen, and myself were on the       right of our companions, examining, as we went along, the       singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us. A       fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention. It was about       wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing, and       extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a       straight course, sloping afterward to the left. The height of the       opening, is far as we could see into it from the main gorge, was       perhaps sixty or seventy feet. There were one or two stunted       shrubs growing from the crevices, bearing a species of filbert       which I felt some curiosity to examine, and pushed in briskly for       that purpose, gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp, and       then hastily retreating. As I turned, I found that Peters and       Allen had followed me. I desired them to go back, as there was       not room for two persons to pass, saying they should have some of       my nuts. They accordingly turned, and were scrambling back, Allen       being close to the mouth of the fissure, when I was suddenly       aware of a concussion resembling nothing I had ever before       experienced, and which impressed me with a vague conception, if       indeed I then thought of anything, that the whole foundations of       the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder, and that the day of       universal dissolution was at hand.     CHAPTER 21         As soon as I could collect my scattered senses, I found myself       nearly suffocated, and grovelling in utter darkness among a       quantity of loose earth, which was also falling upon me heavily       in every direction, threatening to bury me entirely. Horribly       alarmed at this idea, I struggled to gain my feet, and at last       succeeded. I then remained motionless for some moments,       endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me, and where I       was. Presently I heard a deep groan just at my ear, and afterward       the smothered voice of Peters calling to me for aid in the name       of God. I scrambled one or two paces forward, when I fell       directly over the head and shoulders of my companion, who, I soon       discovered, was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his       middle, and struggling desperately to free himself from the       pressure. I tore the dirt from around him with all the energy I       could command, and at length succeeded in getting him out.        As soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise       to be capable of conversing rationally, we both came to the       conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured       had, by some convulsion of nature, or probably from their own       weight, caved in overhead, and that we were consequently lost for       ever, being thus entombed alive. For a long time we gave up       supinely to the most intense agony and despair, such as cannot be       adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar       position. I firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in       the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the       supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our       own, of living inhumation. The blackness of darkness which       envelops the victim, the terrific oppression of lungs, the       stifling fumes from the damp earth, unite with the ghastly       considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope,       and that such is the allotted portion of the dead, to carry into       the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be       tolerated—never to be conceived.        At length Peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain       precisely the extent of our calamity, and grope about our prison;       it being barely possible, he observed, that some opening might       yet be left us for escape. I caught eagerly at this hope, and,       arousing myself to exertion, attempted to force my way through       the loose earth. Hardly had I advanced a single step before a       glimmer of light became perceptible, enough to convince me that,       at all events, we should not immediately perish for want of air.       We now took some degree of heart, and encouraged each other to       hope for the best. Having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which       impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light, we       found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some       relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented       us. Presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects       around, and discovered that we were near the extremity of the       straight portion of the fissure, where it made a turn to the       left. A few struggles more, and we reached the bend, when to our       inexpressible joy, there appeared a long seam or crack extending       upward a vast distance, generally at an angle of about forty-five       degrees, although sometimes much more precipitous. We could not       see through the whole extent of this opening; but, as a good deal       of light came down it, we had little doubt of finding at the top       of it (if we could by any means reach the top) a clear passage       into the open air.        I now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure       from the main gorge, and that our companion, Allen, was still       missing; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for       him. After a long search, and much danger from the farther caving       in of the earth above us, Peters at length cried out to me that       he had hold of our companion’s foot, and that his whole body was       deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of       extricating him. I soon found that what he said was too true, and       that, of course, life had been long extinct. With sorrowful       hearts, therefore, we left the corpse to its fate, and again made       our way to the bend.        The breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us, and,       after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up, we began once       more to despair. I have before said that the chain of hills       through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of       soft rock resembling soapstone. The sides of the cleft we were       now attempting to ascend were of the same material, and so       excessively slippery, being wet, that we could get but little       foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts; in some       places, where the ascent was nearly perpendicular, the difficulty       was, of course, much aggravated; and, indeed, for some time we       thought insurmountable. We took courage, however, from despair,       and what, by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our       bowie knives, and swinging at the risk of our lives, to small       projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and       then protruded from the general mass, we at length reached a       natural platform, from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky,       at the extremity of a thickly-wooded ravine. Looking back now,       with somewhat more leisure, at the passage through which we had       thus far proceeded, we clearly saw from the appearance of its       sides, that it was of late formation, and we concluded that the       concussion, whatever it was, which had so unexpectedly       overwhelmed us, had also, at the same moment, laid open this path       for escape. Being quite exhausted with exertion, and indeed, so       weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate, Peters       now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to       the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our       girdles—the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the       loose earth at the bottom of the chasm. Subsequent events proved       that, had we fired, we should have sorely repented it, but       luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in       my mind, and we forbore to let the savages know of our       whereabouts.        After having reposed for about an hour, we pushed on slowly up       the ravine, and had gone no great way before we heard a       succession of tremendous yells. At length we reached what might       be called the surface of the ground; for our path hitherto, since       leaving the platform, had lain beneath an archway of high rock       and foliage, at a vast distance overhead. With great caution we       stole to a narrow opening, through which we had a clear sight of       the surrounding country, when the whole dreadful secret of the       concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view.        The spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the       highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills. The gorge in       which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet       to the left of us. But, for at least one hundred yards, the       channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the       chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that       had been artificially tumbled within it. The means by which the       vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than       evident, for sure traces of the murderous work were yet       remaining. In several spots along the top of the eastern side of       the gorge (we were now on the western) might be seen stakes of       wood driven into the earth. In these spots the earth had not       given way, but throughout the whole extent of the face of the       precipice from which the mass had fallen, it was clear, from       marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the       rock blaster, that stakes similar to those we saw standing had       been inserted, at not more than a yard apart, for the length of       perhaps three hundred feet, and ranging at about ten feet back       from the edge of the gulf. Strong cords of grape vine were       attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill, and it was       evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the       other stakes. I have already spoken of the singular       stratification of these soapstone hills; and the description just       given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected       our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of       its nature. This was such that almost every natural convulsion       would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or       ridges running parallel with one another, and a very moderate       exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same       purpose. Of this stratification the savages had availed       themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends. There can be no       doubt that, by the continuous line of stakes, a partial rupture       of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one       or two feet, when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each       of the cords (these cords being attached to the tops of the       stakes, and extending back from the edge of the cliff), a vast       leverage power was obtained, capable of hurling the whole face of       the hill, upon a given signal, into the bosom of the abyss below.       The fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of       uncertainty. We alone had escaped from the tempest of that       overwhelming destruction. We were the only living white men upon       the island.     CHAPTER 22         Our situation, as it now appeared, was scarcely less dreadful       than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever. We saw       before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the       savages, or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity       among them. We might, to be sure, conceal ourselves for a time       from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills, and, as       a final resort, in the chasm from which we had just issued; but       we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and       famine, or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain       relief.        The whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages,       crowds of whom, we now perceived, had come over from the islands       to the southward on flat rafts, doubtless with a view of lending       their aid in the capture and plunder of the Jane. The vessel       still lay calmly at anchor in the bay, those on board being       apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them. How we       longed at that moment to be with them! either to aid in effecting       their escape, or to perish with them in attempting a defence. We       saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without       bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads, with but a       remote hope of benefit to them. A pistol fired might suffice to       apprise them that something wrong had occurred; but the report       could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety       lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith—it could not tell       them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain, that       their companions were no longer among the living. Upon hearing       the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet       the foe, who were now getting ready to attack, than they already       were, and always had been. No good, therefore, and infinite harm,       would result from our firing, and after mature deliberation, we       forbore.        Our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel, to       seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay,       and endeavour to force a passage on board. But the utter       impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became       evident. The country, as I said before, was literally swarming       with the natives, skulking among the bushes and recesses of the       hills, so as not to be observed from the schooner. In our       immediate vicinity especially, and blockading the sole path by       which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were       stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors, with       Too-wit at their head, and apparently only waiting for some       re-enforcement to commence his onset upon the Jane. The canoes,       too, which lay at the head of the bay, were manned with savages,       unarmed, it is true, but who undoubtedly had arms within reach.       We were forced, therefore, however unwillingly, to remain in our       place of concealment, mere spectators of the conflict which       presently ensued.        In about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts, or       flatboats, without riggers, filled with savages, and coming round       the southern bight of the harbor. They appeared to have no arms       except short clubs, and stones which lay in the bottom of the       rafts. Immediately afterward another detachment, still larger,       appeared in an opposite direction, and with similar weapons. The       four canoes, too, were now quickly filled with natives, starting       up from the bushes at the head of the bay, and put off swiftly to       join the other parties. Thus, in less time than I have taken to       tell it, and as if by magic, the Jane saw herself surrounded by       an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing       her at all hazards.        That they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an       instant. The six men left in the vessel, however resolutely they       might engage in her defence, were altogether unequal to the       proper management of the guns, or in any manner to sustain a       contest at such odds. I could hardly imagine that they would make       resistance at all, but in this was deceived; for presently I saw       them get springs upon the cable, and bring the vessel’s starboard       broadside to bear upon the canoes, which by this time were within       pistol range, the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to       windward. Owing to some cause unknown, but most probably to the       agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless       a situation, the discharge was an entire failure. Not a canoe was       hit or a single savage injured, the shots striking short and       ricocheting over their heads. The only effect produced upon them       was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke, which was so       excessive that for some moments I almost thought they would       abandon their design entirely, and return to the shore. And this       they would most likely have done had our men followed up their       broadside by a discharge of small arms, in which, as the canoes       were now so near at hand, they could not have failed in doing       some execution, sufficient, at least, to deter this party from a       farther advance, until they could have given the rafts also a       broadside. But, in place of this, they left the canoe party to       recover from their panic, and, by looking about them, to see that       no injury had been sustained, while they flew to the larboard to       get ready for the rafts.        The discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect. The       star and double-headed shot of the large guns cut seven or eight       of the rafts completely asunder, and killed, perhaps, thirty or       forty of the savages outright, while a hundred of them, at least,       were thrown into the water, the most of them dreadfully wounded.       The remainder, frightened out of their senses, commenced at once       a precipitate retreat, not even waiting to pick up their maimed       companions, who were swimming about in every direction, screaming       and yelling for aid. This great success, however, came too late       for the salvation of our devoted people. The canoe party were       already on board the schooner to the number of more than a       hundred and fifty, the most of them having succeeded in       scrambling up the chains and over the boarding-netting even       before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns. Nothing       now could withstand their brute rage. Our men were borne down at       once, overwhelmed, trodden under foot, and absolutely torn to       pieces in an instant.        Seeing this, the savages on the rafts got the better of their       fears, and came up in shoals to the plunder. In five minutes the       Jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage.       The decks were split open and ripped up; the cordage, sails, and       everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic, while, by       dint of pushing at the stern, towing with the canoes, and hauling       at the sides, as they swam in thousands around the vessel, the       wretches finally forced her on shore (the cable having been       slipped), and delivered her over to the good offices of Too-wit,       who, during the whole of the engagement, had maintained, like a       skilful general, his post of security and reconnaissance among       the hills, but, now that the victory was completed to his       satisfaction, condescended to scamper down with his warriors of       the black skin, and become a partaker in the spoils.        Too-wit’s descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and       reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm. At about fifty       yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water, at       which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us. Not far       from the spring we discovered several of the filbert-bushes which       I mentioned before. Upon tasting the nuts we found them       palatable, and very nearly resembling in flavour the common       English filbert. We collected our hats full immediately,       deposited them within the ravine, and returned for more. While we       were busily employed in gathering these, a rustling in the bushes       alarmed us, and we were upon the point of stealing back to our       covert, when a large black bird of the bittern species       strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs. I was so much       startled that I could do nothing, but Peters had sufficient       presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape,       and seize it by the neck. Its struggles and screams were       tremendous, and we had thoughts of letting it go, lest the noise       should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in       the neighbourhood. A stab with a bowie knife, however, at length       brought it to the ground, and we dragged it into the ravine,       congratulating ourselves that, at all events, we had thus       obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week.        We now went out again to look about us, and ventured a       considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill,       but met with nothing else which could serve us for food. We       therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned, seeing       one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the       village, laden with the plunder of the vessel, and who, we were       apprehensive, might discover us in passing beneath the hill.        Our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as       possible, and with this object, we arranged some brushwood over       the aperture which I have before spoken of as the one through       which we saw the patch of blue sky, on reaching the platform from       the interior of the chasm. We left only a very small opening just       wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay, without the risk of       being discovered from below. Having done this, we congratulated       ourselves upon the security of the position; for we were now       completely excluded from observation, as long as we chose to       remain within the ravine itself, and not venture out upon the       hill, We could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been       within this hollow; but, indeed, when we came to reflect upon the       probability that the fissure through which we attained it had       been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite, and       that no other way of attaining it could be perceived, we were not       so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation       as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for       descent. We resolved to explore the summit of the hill       thoroughly, when a good opportunity should offer. In the meantime       we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole.        They had already made a complete wreck of the vessel, and were       now preparing to set her on fire. In a little while we saw the       smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway, and,       shortly afterward, a dense mass of flame burst up from the       forecastle. The rigging, masts and what remained of the sails       caught immediately, and the fire spread rapidly along the decks.       Still a great many of the savages retained their stations about       her, hammering with large stones, axes, and cannon balls at the       bolts and other iron and copper work. On the beach, and in canoes       and rafts, there were not less, altogether, in the immediate       vicinity of the schooner, than ten thousand natives, besides the       shoals of them who, laden with booty, were making their way       inland and over to the neighbouring islands. We now anticipated a       catastrophe, and were not disappointed. First of all there came a       smart shock (which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we       had been slightly galvanized), but unattended with any visible       signs of an explosion. The savages were evidently startled, and       paused for an instant from their labours and yellings. They were       upon the point of recommencing, when suddenly a mass of smoke       puffed up from the decks, resembling a black and heavy       thundercloud—then, as if from its bowels, arose a tall stream of       vivid fire to the height, apparently, of a quarter of a mile—then       there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame—then the       whole atmosphere was magically crowded, in a single instant, with       a wild chaos of wood, and metal, and human limbs—and, lastly,       came the concussion in its fullest fury, which hurled us       impetuously from our feet, while the hills echoed and re-echoed       the tumult, and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the       ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us.        The havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation,       and they had now, indeed, reaped the full and perfect fruits of       their treachery. Perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion,       while at least an equal number were desperately mangled. The       whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling       and drowning wretches, and on shore matters were even worse. They       seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of       their discomfiture, and made no efforts at assisting one another.       At length we observed a total change in their demeanour. From       absolute stupor, they appeared to be, all at once, aroused to the       highest pitch of excitement, and rushed wildly about, going to       and from a certain point on the beach, with the strangest       expressions of mingled horror, rage, and intense curiosity       depicted on their countenances, and shouting, at the top of their       voices, “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”        Presently we saw a large body go off into the hills, whence they       returned in a short time, carrying stakes of wood. These they       brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest, which       now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this       excitement. We perceived something white lying upon the ground,       but could not immediately make out what it was. At length we saw       that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet       teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the       eighteenth of January. Captain Guy had had the body preserved for       the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to England. I       remember he had given some directions about it just before our       making the island, and it had been brought into the cabin and       stowed away in one of the lockers. It had now been thrown on       shore by the explosion; but why it had occasioned so much concern       among the savages was more than we could comprehend. Although       they crowded around the carcass at a little distance, none of       them seemed willing to approach it closely. By-and-by the men       with the stakes drove them in a circle around it, and no sooner       was this arrangement completed, than the whole of the vast       assemblage rushed into the interior of the island, with loud       screams of “Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!”     CHAPTER 23         During the six or seven days immediately following we remained in       our hiding-place upon the hill, going out only occasionally, and       then with the greatest precaution, for water and filberts. We had       made a kind of penthouse on the platform, furnishing it with a       bed of dry leaves, and placing in it three large flat stones,       which served us for both fireplace and table. We kindled a fire       without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together,       the one soft, the other hard. The bird we had taken in such good       season proved excellent eating, although somewhat tough. It was       not an oceanic fowl, but a species of bittern, with jet black and       grizzly plumage, and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk.       We afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the       ravine, apparently seeking for the one we had captured; but, as       they never alighted, we had no opportunity of catching them.        As long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our       situation, but it was now entirely consumed, and it became       absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision. The       filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger, afflicting us,       too, with severe gripings of the bowels, and, if freely indulged       in, with violent headache. We had seen several large tortoises       near the seashore to the eastward of the hill, and perceived they       might be easily taken, if we could get at them without the       observation of the natives. It was resolved, therefore, to make       an attempt at descending.        We commenced by going down the southern declivity, which seemed       to offer the fewest difficulties, but had not proceeded a hundred       yards before (as we had anticipated from appearances on the       hilltop) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the       gorge in which our companions had perished. We now passed along       the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile, when we were       again stopped by a precipice of immense depth, and, not being       able to make our way along the brink of it, we were forced to       retrace our steps by the main ravine.        We now pushed over to the eastward, but with precisely similar       fortune. After an hour’s scramble, at the risk of breaking our       necks, we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit       of black granite, with fine dust at the bottom, and whence the       only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down.       Toiling again up this path, we now tried the northern edge of the       hill. Here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution       in our maneuvers, as the least indiscretion would expose us to       the full view of the savages in the village. We crawled along,       therefore, on our hands and knees, and, occasionally, were even       forced to throw ourselves at full length, dragging our bodies       along by means of the shrubbery. In this careful manner we had       proceeded but a little way, when we arrived at a chasm far deeper       than any we had yet seen, and leading directly into the main       gorge. Thus our fears were fully confirmed, and we found       ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below.       Thoroughly exhausted by our exertions, we made the best of our       way back to the platform, and throwing ourselves upon the bed of       leaves, slept sweetly and soundly for some hours.        For several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in       exploring every part of the summit of the hill, in order to       inform ourselves of its actual resources. We found that it would       afford us no food, with the exception of the unwholesome       filberts, and a rank species of scurvy grass, which grew in a       little patch of not more than four rods square, and would be soon       exhausted. On the fifteenth of February, as near as I can       remember, there was not a blade of this left, and the nuts were       growing scarce; our situation, therefore, could hardly be more       lamentable. {*5} On the sixteenth we again went round the walls       of our prison, in hope of finding some avenue of escape; but to       no purpose. We also descended the chasm in which we had been       overwhelmed, with the faint expectation of discovering, through       this channel, some opening to the main ravine. Here, too, we were       disappointed, although we found and brought up with us a musket.        On the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining       more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made       our way in the first search. We remembered that one of the       fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked       into, and we were anxious to explore it, although with no       expectation of discovering here any opening.        We found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow       as before, and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some       attention. It was, indeed, one of the most singular-looking       places imaginable, and we could scarcely bring ourselves to       believe it altogether the work of nature. The pit, from its       eastern to its western extremity, was about five hundred yards in       length, when all its windings were threaded; the distance from       east to west in a straight line not being more (I should suppose,       having no means of accurate examination) than forty or fifty       yards. Upon first descending into the chasm, that is to say, for       a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill, the sides of       the abyss bore little resemblance to each other, and, apparently,       had at no time been connected, the one surface being of the       soapstone, and the other of marl, granulated with some metallic       matter. The average breadth or interval between the two cliffs       was probably here sixty feet, but there seemed to be no       regularity of formation. Passing down, however, beyond the limit       spoken of, the interval rapidly contracted, and the sides began       to run parallel, although, for some distance farther, they were       still dissimilar in their material and form of surface. Upon       arriving within fifty feet of the bottom, a perfect regularity       commenced. The sides were now entirely uniform in substance, in       colour, and in lateral direction, the material being a very black       and shining granite, and the distance between the two sides, at       all points facing each other, exactly twenty yards. The precise       formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a       delineation taken upon the spot; for I had luckily with me a       pocketbook and pencil, which I preserved with great care through       a long series of subsequent adventure, and to which I am indebted       for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been       crowded from my remembrance.        This figure [No figures in text] gives the general outlines of       the chasm, without the minor cavities in the sides, of which       there were several, each cavity having a corresponding       protuberance opposite. The bottom of the gulf was covered to the       depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable,       beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite. To       the right, at the lower extremity, will be noticed the appearance       of a small opening; this is the fissure alluded to above, and to       examine which more minutely than before was the object of our       second visit. We now pushed into it with vigor, cutting away a       quantity of brambles which impeded us, and removing a vast heap       of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape. We were       encouraged to persevere, however, by perceiving some little light       proceeding from the farther end. We at length squeezed our way       for about thirty feet, and found that the aperture was a low and       regularly formed arch, having a bottom of the same impalpable       powder as that in the main chasm. A strong light now broke upon       us, and, turning a short bend, we found ourselves in another       lofty chamber, similar to the one we had left in every respect       but longitudinal form. Its general figure is here given.        The total length of this chasm, commencing at the opening _a_ and       proceeding round the curve _b_ to the extremity _d_, is five       hundred and fifty yards. At _c_ we discovered a small aperture       similar to the one through which we had issued from the other       chasm, and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles       and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints. We forced our way       through it, finding it about forty feet long, and emerged into a       third chasm. This, too, was precisely like the first, except in       its longitudinal shape, which was thus.        We found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and       twenty yards. At the point _a_ was an opening about six feet       wide, and extending fifteen feet into the rock, where it       terminated in a bed of marl, there being no other chasm beyond,       as we had expected. We were about leaving this fissure, into       which very little light was admitted, when Peters called my       attention to a range of singular-looking indentures in the       surface of the marl forming the termination of the _cul-de-sac_.       With a very slight exertion of the imagination, the left, or most       northern of these indentures might have been taken for the       intentional, although rude, representation of a human figure       standing erect, with outstretched arm. The rest of them bore also       some little resemblance to alphabetical characters, and Peters       was willing, at all events, to adopt the idle opinion that they       were really such. I convinced him of his error, finally, by       directing his attention to the floor of the fissure, where, among       the powder, we picked up, piece by piece, several large flakes of       the marl, which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion       from the surface where the indentures were found, and which had       projecting points exactly fitting the indentures; thus proving       them to have been the work of nature.        After satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded       us no means of escape from our prison, we made our way back,       dejected and dispirited, to the summit of the hill. Nothing worth       mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours, except       that, in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm,       we found two triangular holes of great depth, and also with black       granite sides. Into these holes we did not think it worth while       to attempt descending, as they had the appearance of mere natural       wells, without outlet. They were each about twenty yards in       circumference, and their shape, as well as relative position in       regard to the third chasm, is shown in figure 5. {image}     CHAPTER 24         On the twentieth of the month, finding it altogether impossible       to subsist any longer upon the filberts, the use of which       occasioned us the most excruciating torment, we resolved to make       a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the       hill. The face of the precipice was here of the softest species       of soapstone, although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole       extent (a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least), and in       many places even overarching. After a long search we discovered a       narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf; upon       this Peters contrived to leap, with what assistance I could       render him by means of our pocket-handkerchiefs tied together.       With somewhat more difficulty I also got down; and we then saw       the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in       which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried       by the fall of the hill—that is, by cutting steps in the face of       the soapstone with our knives. The extreme hazard of the attempt       can scarcely be conceived; but, as there was no other resource,       we determined to undertake it.        Upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbert-bushes; and       to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs.       The other end being tied round Peters’ waist, I lowered him down       over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were       stretched tight. He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the       soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the       rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow       of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg       into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four       feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a       peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and       hands. I now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush, throwing       him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole,       letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower       than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of the       handkerchiefs. Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg.       He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just       cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It       was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost       peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he       found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so       great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful       and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on       with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with       his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it       affixed to the peg. Tying the handkerchiefs now to the second       peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not       to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never       have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted       altogether to Peters’ ingenuity and resolution) my companion       finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the       cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.        It was some time before I could summon sufficient resolution to       follow him; but I did at length attempt it. Peters had taken off       his shirt before descending, and this, with my own, formed the       rope necessary for the adventure. After throwing down the musket       found in the chasm, I fastened this rope to the bushes, and let       myself down rapidly, striving, by the vigor of my movements, to       banish the trepidation which I could overcome in no other manner.       This answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps;       but presently I found my imagination growing terribly excited by       thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended, and the       precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my       only support. It was in vain I endeavored to banish these       reflections, and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat       surface of the cliff before me. The more earnestly I struggled       _not to think,_the more intensely vivid became my conceptions,       and the more horribly distinct. At length arrived that crisis of       fancy, so fearful in all similar cases, the crisis in which we       began to anticipate the feelings with which we _shall_fall—to       picture to ourselves the sickness, and dizziness, and the last       struggle, and the half swoon, and the final bitterness of the       rushing and headlong descent. And now I found these fancies       creating their own realities, and all imagined horrors crowding       upon me in fact. I felt my knees strike violently together, while       my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp.       There was a ringing in my ears, and I said, “This is my knell of       death!” And now I was consumed with the irrepressible desire of       looking below. I could not, I would not, confine my glances to       the cliff; and, with a wild, indefinable emotion, half of horror,       half of a relieved oppression, I threw my vision far down into       the abyss. For one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon       their hold, while, with the movement, the faintest possible idea       of ultimate escape wandered, like a shadow, through my mind—in       the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall; a       desire, a yearning, a passion utterly uncontrollable. I let go at       once my grasp upon the peg, and, turning half round from the       precipice, remained tottering for an instant against its naked       face. But now there came a spinning of the brain; a       shrill-sounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears; a       dusky, fiendish, and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me;       and, sighing, I sunk down with a bursting heart, and plunged       within its arms.        I had swooned, and Peters had caught me as I fell. He had       observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the       cliff; and perceiving my imminent danger, had endeavored to       inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise;       although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my       hearing what he said, or being conscious that he had even spoken       to me at all. At length, seeing me totter, he hastened to ascend       to my rescue, and arrived just in time for my preservation. Had I       fallen with my full weight, the rope of linen would inevitably       have snapped, and I should have been precipitated into the abyss;       as it was, he contrived to let me down gently, so as to remain       suspended without danger until animation returned. This was in       about fifteen minutes. On recovery, my trepidation had entirely       vanished; I felt a new being, and, with some little further aid       from my companion, reached the bottom also in safety.        We now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved       the tomb of our friends, and to the southward of the spot where       the hill had fallen. The place was one of singular wildness, and       its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by       travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded       Babylon. Not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff, which       formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward, the       surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with       huge tumuli, apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of       art; although, in detail, no semblance of art could be detected.       Scoria were abundant, and large shapeless blocks of the black       granite, intermingled with others of marl, {*6} and both       granulated with metal. Of vegetation there were no traces       whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within       sight. Several immense scorpions were seen, and various reptiles       not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes. As food was our       most immediate object, we resolved to make our way to the       seacoast, distant not more than half a mile, with a view of       catching turtle, several of which we had observed from our place       of concealment on the hill. We had proceeded some hundred yards,       threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli,       when, upon turning a corner, five savages sprung upon us from a       small cavern, felling Peters to the ground with a blow from a       club. As he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their       victim, leaving me time to recover from my astonishment. I still       had the musket, but the barrel had received so much injury in       being thrown from the precipice that I cast it aside as useless,       preferring to trust my pistols, which had been carefully       preserved in order. With these I advanced upon the assailants,       firing one after the other in quick succession. Two savages fell,       and one, who was in the act of thrusting a spear into Peters,       sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose. My       companion being thus released, we had no further difficulty. He       had his pistols also, but prudently declined using them,       confiding in his great personal strength, which far exceeded that       of any person I have ever known. Seizing a club from one of the       savages who had fallen, he dashed out the brains of the three who       remained, killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the       weapon, and leaving us completely masters of the field.        So rapidly had these events passed, that we could scarcely       believe in their reality, and were standing over the bodies of       the dead in a species of stupid contemplation, when we were       brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance.       It was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing, and       that we had little chance of avoiding discovery. To regain the       cliff, it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the       shouts, and even should we succeed in arriving at its base, we       should never be able to ascend it without being seen. Our       situation was one of the greatest peril, and we were hesitating       in which path to commence a flight, when one of the savages       _whom_I had shot, and supposed dead, sprang briskly to his feet,       and attempted to make his escape. We overtook _him,_however,       before he had advanced many paces, and were about to put him to       death, when Peters suggested that we might derive some benefit       from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape. We       therefore dragged him with us, making him understand that we       would shoot him if he offered resistance. In a few minutes he was       perfectly submissive, and ran by our sides as we pushed in among       the rocks, making for the seashore.        So far, the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing       hid the sea, except at intervals, from our sight, and, when we       first had it fairly in view, it was perhaps two hundred yards       distant. As we emerged into the open beach we saw, to our great       dismay, an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village,       and from all visible quarters of the island, making toward us       with gesticulations of extreme fury, and howling like wild       beasts. We were upon the point of turning upon our steps, and       trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher       ground, when I discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from       behind a large rock which ran out into the water. Toward these we       now ran with all speed, and, reaching them, found them unguarded,       and without any other freight than three of the large Gallipago       turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers. We       instantly took possession of one of them, and, forcing our       captive on board, pushed out to sea with all the strength we       could command.        We had not made, however, more than fifty yards from the shore       before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great       oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe       in the power of the savages, who, by this time, were not more       than twice as far from the beach as ourselves, and were rapidly       advancing to the pursuit. No time was now to be lost. Our hope       was, at best, a forlorn one, but we had none other. It was very       doubtful whether, with the utmost exertion, we could get back in       time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe; but       yet there was a chance that we could. We might save ourselves if       we succeeded, while not to make the attempt was to resign       ourselves to inevitable butchery.        The canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike, and, in       place of turning it around, we merely changed our position in       paddling. As soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled       their yells, as well as their speed, and approached with       inconceivable rapidity. We pulled, however, with all the energy       of desperation, and arrived at the contested point before more       than one of the natives had attained it. This man paid dearly for       his superior agility, Peters shooting him through the head with a       pistol as he approached the shore. The foremost among the rest of       his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we       seized upon the canoe. We at first endeavored to pull her into       the deep water, beyond the reach of the savages, but, finding her       too firmly aground, and there being no time to spare, Peters,       with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket,       succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one       side. We then pushed off. Two of the natives by this time had got       hold of our boat, obstinately refusing to let go, until we were       forced to despatch them with our knives. We were now clear off,       and making great way out to sea. The main body of the savages,       upon reaching the broken canoe, set up the most tremendous yell       of rage and disappointment conceivable. In truth, from everything       I could see of these wretches, they appeared to be the most       wicked, hypocritical, vindictive, bloodthirsty, and altogether       fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe. It is clear we       should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands. They       made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe, but,       finding it useless, again vented their rage in a series of       hideous vociferations, and rushed up into the hills.        We were thus relieved from immediate danger, but our situation       was still sufficiently gloomy. We knew that four canoes of the       kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages,       and were not aware of the fact (afterward ascertained from our       captive) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the       explosion of the _Jane Guy._We calculated, therefore, upon being       yet pursued, as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay       (distant about three miles) where the boats were usually laid up.       Fearing this, we made every exertion to leave the island behind       us, and went rapidly through the water, forcing the prisoner to       take a paddle. In about half an hour, when we had gained probably       five or six miles to the southward, a large fleet of the       flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay       evidently with the design of pursuit. Presently they put back,       despairing to overtake us.     CHAPTER 25         We now found ourselves in the wide and desolate Antarctic Ocean,       in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees, in a frail canoe,       and with no provision but the three turtles. The long polar       winter, too, could not be considered as far distant, and it       became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course       to be pursued. There were six or seven islands in sight belonging       to the same group, and distant from each other about five or six       leagues; but upon neither of these had we any intention to       venture. In coming from the northward in the _Jane Guy_ we had       been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of       ice—this, however little it maybe in accordance with the       generally received notions respecting the Antarctic, was a       fact—experience would not permit us to deny. To attempt,       therefore, getting back would be folly—especially at so late a       period of the season. Only one course seemed to be left open for       hope. We resolved to steer boldly to the southward, where there       was at least a probability of discovering other lands, and more       than a probability of finding a still milder climate.        So far we had found the Antarctic, like the Arctic Ocean,       peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water;       but our canoe was, at best, of frail structure, although large,       and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as       the limited means in our possession would admit. The body of the       boat was of no better material than bark—the bark of a tree       unknown. The ribs were of a tough osier, well adapted to the       purpose for which it was used. We had fifty feet room from stem       to stern, from four to six in breadth, and in depth throughout       four feet and a half-the boats thus differing vastly in shape       from those of any other inhabitants of the Southern Ocean with       whom civilized nations are acquainted. We never did believe them       the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them; and       some days after this period discovered, by questioning our       captive, that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to       the southwest of the country where we found them, having fallen       accidentally into the hands of our barbarians. What we could do       for the security of our boat was very little indeed. Several wide       rents were discovered near both ends, and these we contrived to       patch up with pieces of woollen jacket. With the help of the       superfluous paddles, of which there were a great many, we erected       a kind of framework about the bow, so as to break the force of       any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter. We also       set up two paddle-blades for masts, placing them opposite each       other, one by each gunwale, thus saving the necessity of a yard.       To these masts we attached a sail made of our shirts-doing this       with some difficulty, as here we could get no assistance from our       prisoner whatever, although he had been willing enough to labor       in all the other operations. The sight of the linen seemed to       affect him in a very singular manner. He could not be prevailed       upon to touch it or go near it, shuddering when we attempted to       force him, and shrieking out, _“Tekeli-li!”_        Having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of       the canoe, we now set sail to the south-southeast for the       present, with the view of weathering the most southerly of the       group in sight. This being done, we turned the bow full to the       southward. The weather could by no means be considered       disagreeable. We had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the       northward, a smooth sea, and continual daylight. No ice whatever       was to be seen; _nor did I ever see one particle of this after       leaving the parallel of Bennet’s Islet._Indeed, the temperature       of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any       quantity. Having killed the largest of our tortoises, and       obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water, we       continued on our course, without any incident of moment, for       perhaps seven or eight days, during which period we must have       proceeded a vast distance to the southward, as the wind blew       constantly with us, and a very strong current set continually in       the direction we were pursuing.        _March 1st_. {*7}-Many unusual phenomena now—indicated that we       were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder. A high range       of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon,       flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks, now darting from east       to west, now from west to east, and again presenting a level and       uniform summit—in short, having all the wild variations of the       Aurora Borealis. The average height of this vapor, as apparent       from our station, was about twenty-five degrees. The temperature       of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily, and there was a       very perceptible alteration in its color.        _March 2d._-To-day by repeated questioning of our captive, we       came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island       of the massacre, its inhabitants, and customs—but with these how       can I now detain the reader? I may say, however, that we learned       there were eight islands in the group—that they were governed by       a common king, named _Tsalemon_or _Psalemoun,_who resided in one       of the smallest of the islands; that the black skins forming the       dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be       found only in a valley near the court of the king—that the       inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the       flat-bottomed rafts; the four canoes being all of the kind in       their possession, and, these having been obtained, by mere       accident, from some large island in the southwest—that his own       name was Nu-Nu—that he had no knowledge of Bennet’s Islet—and       that the appellation of the island he had left was Tsalal. The       commencement of the words _Tsalemon_and Tsalal was given with a       prolonged hissing sound, which we found it impossible to imitate,       even after repeated endeavors, and which was precisely the same       with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit       of the hill.        _March 3d._-The heat of the water was now truly remarkable, and       in color was undergoing a rapid change, being no longer       transparent, but of a milky consistency and hue. In our immediate       vicinity it was usually smooth, never so rough as to endanger the       canoe—but we were frequently surprised at perceiving, to our       right and left, at different distances, sudden and extensive       agitations of the surface; these, we at length noticed, were       always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the       southward.        _March 4th._-To-day, with the view of widening our sail, the       breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly, I took from my       coat-pocket a white handkerchief. Nu-Nu was seated at my elbow,       and the linen accidentally flaring in his face, he became       violently affected with convulsions. These were succeeded by       drowsiness and stupor, and low murmurings of _“‘Tekeli-li!       Tekeli-li!”_        _March_5th.-The wind had entirely ceased, but it was evident that       we were still hurrying on to the southward, under the influence       of a powerful current. And now,—indeed, it would seem reasonable       that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were       taking—but we felt none. The countenance of Peters indicated       nothing of this nature, although it wore at times an expression I       could not fathom. The polar winter appeared to be coming on—but       coming without its terrors. I felt a numbness of body and mind—a       dreaminess of sensation but this was all.        _March 6th._-The gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees       above the horizon, and was gradually losing its grayness of tint.       The heat of the water was extreme, even unpleasant to the touch,       and its milky hue was more evident than ever. Today a violent       agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe. It was       attended, as usual, with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its       summit, and a momentary division at its base. A fine white       powder, resembling ashes—but certainly not such—fell over the       canoe and over a large surface of the water, as the flickering       died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea.       Nu-Nu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat,       and no persuasions could induce him to arise.        _March 7th._-This day we questioned Nu-Nu concerning the motives       of his countrymen in destroying our companions; but he appeared       to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational       reply. He still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat; and,       upon reiterating the questions as to the motive, made use only of       idiotic gesticulations, such as raising with his forefinger the       upper lip, and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it. These       were black. We had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant       of Tsalal.        _March 8th._-To-day there floated by us one of the white animals       whose appearance upon the beach at Tsalal had occasioned so wild       a commotion among the savages. I would have picked it up, but       there came over me a sudden listlessness, and I forbore. The heat       of the water still increased, and the hand could no longer be       endured within it. Peters spoke little, and I knew not what to       think of his apathy. Nu-Nu breathed, and no more.        _March 9th._-The whole ashy material fell now continually around       us, and in vast quantities. The range of vapor to the southward       had arisen prodigiously in the horizon, and began to assume more       distinctness of form. I can liken it to nothing but a limitless       cataract, rolling silently into the sea from some immense and       far-distant rampart in the heaven. The gigantic curtain ranged       along the whole extent of the southern horizon. It emitted no       sound.        _March 21st._-A sullen darkness now hovered above us—but from out       the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose, and stole       up along the bulwarks of the boat. We were nearly overwhelmed by       the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe,       but melted into the water as it fell. The summit of the cataract       was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance. Yet we were       evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity. At intervals       there were visible in it wide, yawning, but momentary rents, and       from out these rents, within which was a chaos of flitting and       indistinct images, there came rushing and mighty, but soundless       winds, tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course.        _March 22d._-The darkness had materially increased, relieved only       by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain       before us. Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew       continuously now from beyond the veil, and their scream was the       eternal _Tekeli-li!_as they retreated from our vision. Hereupon       Nu-Nu stirred in the bottom of the boat; but upon touching him we       found his spirit departed. And now we rushed into the embraces of       the cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. But       there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very far       larger in its proportions than any dweller among men. And the hue       of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the       snow.        NOTE        THE circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing       death of Mr. Pym are already well known to the public through the       medium of the daily press. It is feared that the few remaining       chapters which were to have completed his narrative, and which       were retained by him, while the above were in type, for the       purpose of revision, have been irrecoverably lost through the       accident by which he perished himself. This, however, may prove       not to be the case, and the papers, if ultimately found, will be       given to the public.        No means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency. The       gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface, and who, from       the statement there made, might be supposed able to fill the       vacuum, has declined the task—this, for satisfactory reasons       connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded       him, and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions       of the narration. Peters, from whom some information might be       expected, is still alive, and a resident of Illinois, but cannot       be met with at present. He may hereafter be found, and will, no       doubt, afford material for a conclusion of Mr. Pym’s account.        The loss of two or three final chapters (for there were but two       or three) is the more deeply to be regretted, as it can not be       doubted they contained matter relative to the Pole itself, or at       least to regions in its very near proximity; and as, too, the       statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly       be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental       expedition now preparing for the Southern Ocean.        On one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered;       and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if       what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit,       in any degree, upon the very singular pages now published. We       allude to the chasms found in the island of Tsalal, and to the       whole of the figures upon pages 245-47 {of the printed       edition—ed.}.        (Note: No figures were included with this text)        Mr. Pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment, and       speaks decidedly of the _indentures_found at the extremity of the       most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful       resemblance to alphabetical characters, and, in short, as being       positively _not such. _This assertion is made in a manner so       simple, and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive       (viz., the fitting of the projections of the fragments found       among the dust into the indentures upon the wall), that we are       forced to believe the writer in earnest; and no reasonable reader       should suppose otherwise. But as the facts in relation to all the       figures are most singular (especially when taken in connection       with statements made in the body of the narrative), it may be as       well to say a word or two concerning them all—this, too, the more       especially as the facts in question have, beyond doubt, escaped       the attention of Mr. Poe.        Figure 1, then, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 5, when conjoined       with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves       presented, and when deprived of the small lateral branches or       arches (which, it will be remembered, served only as a means of       communication between the main chambers, and were of totally       distinct character), constitute an Ethiopian verbal root—the root       “To be shady,’—whence all the inflections of shadow or darkness.        In regard to the “left or most northwardly” of the indentures in       figure 4, it is more than probable that the opinion of Peters was       correct, and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the       work of art, and intended as the representation of a human form.       The delineation is before the reader, and he may, or may not,       perceive the resemblance suggested; but the rest of the       indentures afford strong confirmation of Peters’ idea. The upper       range is evidently the Arabic verbal root “To be white,” whence       all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness. The lower range       is not so immediately perspicuous. The characters are somewhat       broken and disjointed; nevertheless, it can not be doubted that,       in their perfect state, they formed the full Egyptian word, “The       region of the south.” It should be observed that these       interpretations confirm the opinion of Peters in regard to the       “most northwardly” of the figures. The arm is outstretched toward       the south.        Conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and       exciting conjecture. They should be regarded, perhaps, in       connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of       the narrative; although in no visible manner is this chain of       connection complete. Tekeli-li! was the cry of the affrighted       natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the       _white_animal picked up at sea. This also was the shuddering       exclamatives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the       _white_materials in possession of Mr. Pym. This also was the       shriek of the swift-flying, _white, _and gigantic birds which       issued from the vapory _white_curtain of the South. Nothing       _white_was to be found at Tsalal, and nothing otherwise in the       subsequent voyage to the region beyond. It is not impossible that       “Tsalal,” the appellation of the island of the chasms, may be       found, upon minute philological scrutiny, to betray either some       alliance with the chasms themselves, or some reference to the       Ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings.        _“I have graven it within the hills, and my vengeance upon the       dust within the rock.”_     NOTES TO THE THIRD VOLUME         {*1} Whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oil-tanks—why       the _Grampus_ was not I have never been able to ascertain.        {*2} The case of the brig _Polly_, of Boston, is one so much in       point, and her fate, in many respects, so remarkably similar to       our own, that I cannot forbear alluding to it here. This vessel,       of one hundred and thirty tons burden, sailed from Boston, with a       cargo of lumber and provisions, for Santa Croix, on the twelfth       of December, 1811, under the command of Captain Casneau. There       were eight souls on board besides the captain—the mate, four       seamen, and the cook, together with a Mr. Hunt, and a negro girl       belonging to him. On the fifteenth, having cleared the shoal of       Georges, she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast,       and was finally capsized; but, the masts going by the board, she       afterward righted. They remained in this situation, without fire,       and with very little provision, for the period of one hundred and       ninety-one days (from December the fifteenth to June the       twentieth), when Captain Casneau and Samuel Badger, the only       survivors, were taken off the wreck by the Fame, of Hull, Captain       Featherstone, bound home from Rio Janeiro. When picked up, they       were in latitude 28 degrees N., longitude 13 degrees W., having       drifted above two thousand miles! On the ninth of July the Fame       fell in with the brig Dromero, Captain Perkins, who landed the       two sufferers in Kennebeck. The narrative from which we gather       these details ends in the following words:        “It is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast       distance, upon the most frequented part of the Atlantic, and not       be discovered all this time. They were passed by more than a       dozen sail, one of which came so nigh them that they could       distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at       them; but, to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving       and freezing men, they stifled the dictates of compassion,       hoisted sail, and cruelly abandoned them to their fate.”        {*3} Among the vessels which at various times have professed to       meet with the Auroras may be mentioned the ship San Miguel, in       1769; the ship Aurora, in 1774; the brig Pearl, in 1779; and the       ship Dolores, in 1790. They all agree in giving the mean latitude       fifty-three degrees south.        {*4} The terms morning and evening, which I have made use of to       avoid confusion in my narrative, as far as possible, must not, of       course, be taken in their ordinary sense. For a long time past we       had had no night at all, the daylight being continual. The dates       throughout are according to nautical time, and the bearing must       be understood as per compass. I would also remark, in this place,       that I cannot, in the first portion of what is here written,       pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates, or latitudes and       longitudes, having kept no regular journal until after the period       of which this first portion treats. In many instances I have       relied altogether upon memory.        {*5} This day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the       south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour I have spoken       of.        {*6} The marl was also black; indeed, we noticed no light colored       substances of any kind upon the island.        {*7}For obvious reasons I cannot pretend to strict accuracy in       these dates. They are given principally with a view to perspicity       of narrative, and as set down in my pencil memorandum.     LIGEIA         And the will therein lieth, which dieth not. Who knoweth the       mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is but a great       will pervading all things by nature of its intentness. Man doth       not yield himself to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save       only through the weakness of his feeble will.—_Joseph Glanvill_.        I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely       where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long years       have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much       suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot now bring these points to mind,       because, in truth, the character of my beloved, her rare       learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and the       thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language,       made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily       progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown. Yet I       believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large,       old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family—I have surely       heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be       doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! Buried in studies of a nature more than       all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it       is by that sweet word alone—by Ligeia—that I bring before mine       eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while I       write, a recollection flashes upon me that I have never known the       paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed, and who       became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife of my       bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia? or was       it a test of my strength of affection, that I should institute no       inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a caprice of my own—a       wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate       devotion? I but indistinctly recall the fact itself—what wonder       that I have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated       or attended it? And, indeed, if ever that spirit which is       entitled _Romance_—if ever she, the wan and the misty-winged       _Ashtophet_ of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell, over       marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over mine.        There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails me       not. It is the person of Ligeia. In stature she was tall,       somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even emaciated. I       would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the quiet ease, of       her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of       her footfall. She came and departed as a shadow. I was never made       aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music       of her low sweet voice, as she placed her marble hand upon my       shoulder. In beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her. It was       the radiance of an opium-dream—an airy and spirit-lifting vision       more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the       slumbering souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were       not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to       worship in the classical labors of the heathen. “There is no       exquisite beauty,” says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of       all the forms and genera of beauty, “without some strangeness in       the proportion.” Yet, although I saw that the features of Ligeia       were not of a classic regularity—although I perceived that her       loveliness was indeed “exquisite,” and felt that there was much       of “strangeness” pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect       the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of “the       strange.” I examined the contour of the lofty and pale       forehead—it was faultless—how cold indeed that word when applied       to a majesty so divine!—the skin rivalling the purest ivory, the       commanding extent and repose, the gentle prominence of the       regions above the temples; and then the raven-black, the glossy,       the luxuriant and naturally-curling tresses, setting forth the       full force of the Homeric epithet, “hyacinthine!” I looked at the       delicate outlines of the nose—and nowhere but in the graceful       medallions of the Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection.       There were the same luxurious smoothness of surface, the same       scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline, the same       harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit. I regarded       the sweet mouth. Here was indeed the triumph of all things       heavenly—the magnificent turn of the short upper lip—the soft,       voluptuous slumber of the under—the dimples which sported, and       the color which spoke—the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy       almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon       them in her serene and placid, yet most exultingly radiant of all       smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the chin—and here, too, I       found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and the majesty,       the fullness and the spirituality, of the Greek—the contour which       the god Apollo revealed but in a dream, to Cleomenes, the son of       the Athenian. And then I peered into the large eyes of Ligeia.        For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might have       been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to       which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far larger       than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even fuller       than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley       of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals—in moments of intense       excitement—that this peculiarity became more than slightly       noticeable in Ligeia. And at such moments was her beauty—in my       heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps—the beauty of beings either       above or apart from the earth—the beauty of the fabulous Houri of       the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,       and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The brows,       slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The       “strangeness,” however, which I found in the eyes, was of a       nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the       brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to       the expression. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose vast       latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of       the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia! How for long       hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through the whole of a       midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What was it—that       something more profound than the well of Democritus—which lay far       within the pupils of my beloved? What was it? I was possessed       with a passion to discover. Those eyes! those large, those       shining, those divine orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda,       and I to them devoutest of astrologers.        There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies of       the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the       fact—never, I believe, noticed in the schools—that, in our       endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten, we often       find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being       able, in the end, to remember. And thus how frequently, in my       intense scrutiny of Ligeia’s eyes, have I felt approaching the       full knowledge of their expression—felt it approaching—yet not       quite be mine—and so at length entirely depart! And (strange, oh       strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest objects of       the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I mean to       say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia’s beauty passed       into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I derived, from       many existences in the material world, a sentiment such as I felt       always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs. Yet not       the more could I define that sentiment, or analyze, or even       steadily view it. I recognized it, let me repeat, sometimes in       the survey of a rapidly-growing vine—in the contemplation of a       moth, a butterfly, a chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have       felt it in the ocean—in the falling of a meteor. I have felt it       in the glances of unusually aged people. And there are one or two       stars in heaven—(one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude,       double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)       in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the       feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from       stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from       books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember       something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely       from its quaintness—who shall say?) never failed to inspire me       with the sentiment: “And the will therein lieth, which dieth not.       Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with its vigor? For God is       but a great will pervading all things by nature of its       intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto death       utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble will.”        Length of years, and subsequent reflection, have enabled me to       trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in the       English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia. An       intensity in thought, action, or speech, was possibly, in her, a       result, or at least an index, of that gigantic volition which,       during our long intercourse, failed to give other and more       immediate evidence of its existence. Of all the women whom I have       ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the ever-placid Ligeia, was       the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern       passion. And of such passion I could form no estimate, save by       the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted       and appalled me—by the almost magical melody, modulation,       distinctness and placidity of her very low voice—and by the       fierce energy (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her       manner of utterance) of the wild words which she habitually       uttered.        I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was immense—such as I       have never known in woman. In the classical tongues was she       deeply proficient, and as far as my own acquaintance extended in       regard to the modern dialects of Europe, I have never known her       at fault. Indeed upon any theme of the most admired, because       simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy,       have I ever found Ligeia at fault? How singularly—how       thrillingly, this one point in the nature of my wife has forced       itself, at this late period only, upon my attention! I said her       knowledge was such as I have never known in woman—but where       breathes the man who has traversed, and successfully, all the       wide areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw       not then what I now clearly perceive, that the acquisitions of       Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently       aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a       child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic world       of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily occupied       during the earlier years of our marriage. With how vast a       triumph—with how vivid a delight—with how much of all that is       ethereal in hope did I feel, as she bent over me in studies but       little sought—but less known—that delicious vista by slow degrees       expanding before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden       path, I might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too       divinely precious not to be forbidden!        How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which, after       some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take wings to       themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a child       groping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone, rendered       vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in       which we were immersed. Wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes,       letters, lambent and golden, grew duller than Saturnian lead. And       now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over       which I pored. Ligeia grew ill. The wild eyes blazed with a       too—too glorious effulgence; the pale fingers became of the       transparent waxen hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the       lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the       gentle emotion. I saw that she must die—and I struggled       desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles of       the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more energetic       than my own. There had been much in her stern nature to impress       me with the belief that, to her, death would have come without       its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to convey any just       idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with       the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle. I       would have soothed—I would have reasoned; but, in the intensity       of her wild desire for life,—for life—but for life—solace and       reason were the uttermost folly. Yet not until the last instance,       amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit, was       shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her voice grew       more gentle—grew more low—yet I would not wish to dwell upon the       wild meaning of the quietly uttered words. My brain reeled as I       hearkened, entranced, to a melody more than mortal—to assumptions       and aspirations which mortality had never before known.        That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might have       been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love would have       reigned no ordinary passion. But in death only, was I fully       impressed with the strength of her affection. For long hours,       detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the overflowing       of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to       idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by such       confessions?—how had I deserved to be so cursed with the removal       of my beloved in the hour of her making them? But upon this       subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only, that in       Ligeia’s more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas! all       unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length recognized the       principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the       life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this wild       longing—it is this eager vehemence of desire for life—but for       life—that I have no power to portray—no utterance capable of       expressing.        At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning me,       peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain verses       composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her. They were       these:  Lo! ’tis a gala night     Within the lonesome latter years! An angel throng, bewinged, bedight     In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see     A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully     The music of the spheres.  Mimes, in the form of God on high,     Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly;     Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things     That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings     Invisible Wo!  That motley drama!—oh, be sure     It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased forever more,     By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in     To the self-same spot, And much of Madness and more of Sin     And Horror the soul of the plot.  But see, amid the mimic rout,     A crawling shape intrude! A blood-red thing that writhes from out     The scenic solitude! It writhes!—it writhes!—with mortal pangs     The mimes become its food, And the seraphs sob at vermin fangs     In human gore imbued.  Out—out are the lights—out all!     And over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall,     Comes down with the rush of a storm, And the angels, all pallid and wan,     Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, “Man,”     And its hero the Conqueror Worm.        “O God!” half shrieked Ligeia, leaping to her feet and extending       her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement, as I made an end of       these lines—“O God! O Divine Father!—shall these things be       undeviatingly so?—shall this Conqueror be not once conquered? Are       we not part and parcel in Thee? Who—who knoweth the mysteries of       the will with its vigor? Man doth not yield him to the angels,       nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his       feeble will.”        And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her white       arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death. And as       she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with them a low       murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear and distinguished,       again, the concluding words of the passage in Glanvill—“Man doth       not yield him to the angels, nor unto death utterly, save only       through the weakness of his feeble will.”        She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow, could no       longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and       decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what the world calls       wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very far more than       ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a few months,       therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I purchased, and put       in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not name, in one of the       wildest and least frequented portions of fair England. The gloomy       and dreary grandeur of the building, the almost savage aspect of       the domain, the many melancholy and time-honored memories       connected with both, had much in unison with the feelings of       utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and       unsocial region of the country. Yet although the external abbey,       with its verdant decay hanging about it, suffered but little       alteration, I gave way, with a child-like perversity, and       perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows, to a       display of more than regal magnificence within. For such follies,       even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste and now they came back       to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I feel how much even of       incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and       fantastic draperies, in the solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild       cornices and furniture, in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of       tufted gold! I had become a bounden slave in the trammels of       opium, and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my       dreams. But these absurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me       speak only of that one chamber, ever accursed, whither in a       moment of mental alienation, I led from the altar as my bride—as       the successor of the unforgotten Ligeia—the fair-haired and       blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.        There is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration       of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me. Where       were the souls of the haughty family of the bride, when, through       thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the threshold of an       apartment so bedecked, a maiden and a daughter so beloved? I have       said that I minutely remember the details of the chamber—yet I am       sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment—and here there was no       system, no keeping, in the fantastic display, to take hold upon       the memory. The room lay in a high turret of the castellated       abbey, was pentagonal in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying       the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole window—an       immense sheet of unbroken glass from Venice—a single pane, and       tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or       moon, passing through it, fell with a ghastly lustre on the       objects within. Over the upper portion of this huge window,       extended the trellice-work of an aged vine, which clambered up       the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking       oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted with       the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,       semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this       melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with       long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in       pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there       writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent vitality,       a continual succession of parti-colored fires.        Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure, were       in various stations about—and there was the couch, too—bridal       couch—of an Indian model, and low, and sculptured of solid ebony,       with a pall-like canopy above. In each of the angles of the       chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite,       from the tombs of the kings over against Luxor, with their aged       lids full of immemorial sculpture. But in the draping of the       apartment lay, alas! the chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls,       gigantic in height—even unproportionably so—were hung from summit       to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking       tapestry—tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet       on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed,       as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes of the       curtains which partially shaded the window. The material was the       richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at irregular       intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in diameter, and       wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black. But       these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only       when regarded from a single point of view. By a contrivance now       common, and indeed traceable to a very remote period of       antiquity, they were made changeable in aspect. To one entering       the room, they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities; but       upon a farther advance, this appearance gradually departed; and       step by step, as the visitor moved his station in the chamber, he       saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly       forms which belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in       the guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effect was       vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong       continual current of wind behind the draperies—giving a hideous       and uneasy animation to the whole.        In halls such as these—in a bridal chamber such as this—I passed,       with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed hours of the first       month of our marriage—passed them with but little disquietude.       That my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temper—that she       shunned me and loved me but little—I could not help perceiving;       but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with       a hatred belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew       back, (oh, with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the       beloved, the august, the beautiful, the entombed. I revelled in       recollections of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty, her       ethereal nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now,       then, did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the       fires of her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was       habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug) I would call       aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among       the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the       wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my       longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathway she       had abandoned—ah, could it be forever?—upon the earth.        About the commencement of the second month of the marriage, the       Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which her       recovery was slow. The fever which consumed her rendered her       nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber, she       spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber of the       turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the distemper of       her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the       chamber itself. She became at length convalescent—finally well.       Yet but a brief period elapsed, ere a second more violent       disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this       attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether       recovered. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming       character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the       knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. With the       increase of the chronic disease which had thus, apparently, taken       too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human       means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in the       nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her excitability by       trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and now more frequently       and pertinaciously, of the sounds—of the slight sounds—and of the       unusual motions among the tapestries, to which she had formerly       alluded.        One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed this       distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my       attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I       had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague       terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the       side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She       partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds       which she then heard, but which I could not hear—of motions which       she then saw, but which I could not perceive. The wind was       rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries, and I wished to show her       (what, let me confess it, I could not all believe) that those       almost inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations       of the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of       that customary rushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor,       overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to       reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting, and       no attendants were within call. I remembered where was deposited       a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her       physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it. But,       as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two circumstances       of a startling nature attracted my attention. I had felt that       some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my       person; and I saw that there lay upon the golden carpet, in the       very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer, a shadow—a       faint, indefinite shadow of angelic aspect—such as might be       fancied for the shadow of a shade. But I was wild with the       excitement of an immoderate dose of opium, and heeded these       things but little, nor spoke of them to Rowena. Having found the       wine, I recrossed the chamber, and poured out a gobletful, which       I held to the lips of the fainting lady. She had now partially       recovered, however, and took the vessel herself, while I sank       upon an ottoman near me, with my eyes fastened upon her person.       It was then that I became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall       upon the carpet, and near the couch; and in a second thereafter,       as Rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw,       or may have dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if       from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three       or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If       this I saw—not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly,       and I forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must, after       all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a vivid       imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady,       by the opium, and by the hour.        Yet I cannot conceal it from my own perception that, immediately       subsequent to the fall of the ruby-drops, a rapid change for the       worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on the       third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared her for       the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her shrouded body,       in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride.       Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted, shadow-like, before me.       I gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the       room, upon the varying figures of the drapery, and upon the       writhing of the parti-colored fires in the censer overhead. My       eyes then fell, as I called to mind the circumstances of a former       night, to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where I had       seen the faint traces of the shadow. It was there, however, no       longer; and breathing with greater freedom, I turned my glances       to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me       a thousand memories of Ligeia—and then came back upon my heart,       with the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that       unutterable woe with which I had regarded her thus enshrouded.       The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of bitter thoughts       of the one only and supremely beloved, I remained gazing upon the       body of Rowena.        It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later, for I       had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but very       distinct, startled me from my revery. I _felt_ that it came from       the bed of ebony—the bed of death. I listened in an agony of       superstitious terror—but there was no repetition of the sound. I       strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse—but there       was not the slightest perceptible. Yet I could not have been       deceived. I had heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was       awakened within me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my       attention riveted upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any       circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At       length it became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely       noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and       along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species of       unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of mortality       has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my heart cease       to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a sense of duty       finally operated to restore my self-possession. I could no longer       doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations—that       Rowena still lived. It was necessary that some immediate exertion       be made; yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of       the abbey tenanted by the servants—there were none within call—I       had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room       for many minutes—and this I could not venture to do. I therefore       struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill       hovering. In a short period it was certain, however, that a       relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid       and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the       lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly       expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness       overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual       rigorous illness immediately supervened. I fell back with a       shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly       aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of       Ligeia.        An hour thus elapsed when (could it be possible?) I was a second       time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the       bed. I listened—in extremity of horror. The sound came again—it       was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I saw—distinctly saw—a tremor       upon the lips. In a minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a       bright line of the pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in my       bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there       alone. I felt that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered;       and it was only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in       nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed       out. There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the       cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame;       there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady lived;       and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the task of       restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples and the hands, and       used every exertion which experience, and no little medical       reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the color fled,       the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the expression of the       dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole body took upon       itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the intense rigidity,       the sunken outline, and all the loathsome peculiarities of that       which has been, for many days, a tenant of the tomb.        And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia—and again, (what marvel       that I shudder while I write?), again there reached my ears a low       sob from the region of the ebony bed. But why shall I minutely       detail the unspeakable horrors of that night? Why shall I pause       to relate how, time after time, until near the period of the gray       dawn, this hideous drama of revivification was repeated; how each       terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more       irredeemable death; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle       with some invisible foe; and how each struggle was succeeded by I       know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the       corpse? Let me hurry to a conclusion.        The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she who       had been dead, once again stirred—and now more vigorously than       hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in       its utter hopelessness than any. I had long ceased to struggle or       to move, and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman, a       helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions, of which extreme       awe was perhaps the least terrible, the least consuming. The       corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now more vigorously than before.       The hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the       countenance—the limbs relaxed—and, save that the eyelids were yet       pressed heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of       the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I       might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,       the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then,       altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,       arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed       eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the thing       that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle       of the apartment.        I trembled not—I stirred not—for a crowd of unutterable fancies       connected with the air, the stature, the demeanor of the figure,       rushing hurriedly through my brain, had paralyzed—had chilled me       into stone. I stirred not—but gazed upon the apparition. There       was a mad disorder in my thoughts—a tumult unappeasable. Could       it, indeed, be the living Rowena who confronted me? Could it       indeed be Rowena at all—the fair-haired, the blue-eyed Lady       Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why, why should I doubt it? The       bandage lay heavily about the mouth—but then might it not be the       mouth of the breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks—there       were the roses as in her noon of life—yes, these might indeed be       the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,       with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?—but had she       then grown taller since her malady? What inexpressible madness       seized me with that thought? One bound, and I had reached her       feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let fall from her head,       unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had confined it, and       there streamed forth, into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber,       huge masses of long and dishevelled hair; _it was blacker than       the raven wings of the midnight!_ And now slowly opened the eyes       of the figure which stood before me. “Here then, at least,” I       shrieked aloud, “can I never—can I never be mistaken—these are       the full, and the black, and the wild eyes—of my lost love—of the       Lady—of the LADY LIGEIA.”     MORELLA        Itself, by itself, solely, one everlasting, and single.                     —PLATO—_Sympos_.        With a feeling of deep yet most singular affection I regarded my       friend Morella. Thrown by accident into her society many years       ago, my soul from our first meeting, burned with fires it had       never before known; but the fires were not of Eros, and bitter       and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that I       could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their       vague intensity. Yet we met; and fate bound us together at the       altar; and I never spoke of passion nor thought of love. She,       however, shunned society, and, attaching herself to me alone       rendered me happy. It is a happiness to wonder; it is a happiness       to dream.        Morella’s erudition was profound. As I hope to live, her talents       were of no common order—her powers of mind were gigantic. I felt       this, and, in many matters, became her pupil. I soon, however,       found that, perhaps on account of her Presburg education, she       placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are       usually considered the mere dross of the early German literature.       These, for what reason I could not imagine, were her favourite       and constant study—and that in process of time they became my       own, should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence       of habit and example.        In all this, if I err not, my reason had little to do. My       convictions, or I forget myself, were in no manner acted upon by       the ideal, nor was any tincture of the mysticism which I read to       be discovered, unless I am greatly mistaken, either in my deeds       or in my thoughts. Persuaded of this, I abandoned myself       implicitly to the guidance of my wife, and entered with an       unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies. And       then—then, when, poring over forbidden pages, I felt a forbidden       spirit enkindling within me—would Morella place her cold hand       upon my own, and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some       low, singular words, whose strange meaning burned themselves in       upon my memory. And then, hour after hour, would I linger by her       side, and dwell upon the music of her voice, until at length its       melody was tainted with terror, and there fell a shadow upon my       soul, and I grew pale, and shuddered inwardly at those too       unearthly tones. And thus, joy suddenly faded into horror, and       the most beautiful became the most hideous, as Hinnon became       Ge-Henna.        It is unnecessary to state the exact character of those       disquisitions which, growing out of the volumes I have mentioned,       formed, for so long a time, almost the sole conversation of       Morella and myself. By the learned in what might be termed       theological morality they will be readily conceived, and by the       unlearned they would, at all events, be little understood. The       wild Pantheism of Fichte; the modified Paliggenedia of the       Pythagoreans; and, above all, the doctrines of Identity as urged       by Schelling, were generally the points of discussion presenting       the most of beauty to the imaginative Morella. That identity       which is termed personal, Mr. Locke, I think, truly defines to       consist in the saneness of rational being. And since by person we       understand an intelligent essence having reason, and since there       is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking, it is this       which makes us all to be that which we call _ourselves_—thereby       distinguishing us from other beings that think, and giving us our       personal identity. But the _principium indivduationis_, the       notion of that identity _which at death is or is not lost       forever_—was to me, at all times, a consideration of intense       interest; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its       consequences, than from the marked and agitated manner in which       Morella mentioned them.        But, indeed, the time had now arrived when the mystery of my       wife’s manner oppressed me as a spell. I could no longer bear the       touch of her wan fingers, nor the low tone of her musical       language, nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes. And she knew all       this, but did not upbraid; she seemed conscious of my weakness or       my folly, and, smiling, called it Fate. She seemed, also,       conscious of a cause, to me unknown, for the gradual alienation       of my regard; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature. Yet       was she woman, and pined away daily. In time the crimson spot       settled steadily upon the cheek, and the blue veins upon the pale       forehead became prominent; and one instant my nature melted into       pity, but in, next I met the glance of her meaning eyes, and then       my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who       gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss.        Shall I then say that I longed with an earnest and consuming       desire for the moment of Morella’s decease? I did; but the       fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days—for       many weeks and irksome months, until my tortured nerves obtained       the mastery over my mind, and I grew furious through delay, and,       with the heart of a fiend, cursed the days and the hours and the       bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her       gentle life declined—like shadows in the dying of the day.        But one autumnal evening, when the winds lay still in heaven,       Morella called me to her bedside. There was a dim mist over all       the earth, and a warm glow upon the waters, and amid the rich       October leaves of the forest, a rainbow from the firmament had       surely fallen.        “It is a day of days,” she said, as I approached; “a day of all       days either to live or die. It is a fair day for the sons of       earth and life—ah, more fair for the daughters of heaven and       death!”        I kissed her forehead, and she continued:        “I am dying, yet shall I live.”        “Morella!”        “The days have never been when thou couldst love me—but her whom       in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore.”        “Morella!”        “I repeat that I am dying. But within me is a pledge of that       affection—ah, how little!—which thou didst feel for me, Morella.       And when my spirit departs shall the child live—thy child and       mine, Morella’s. But thy days shall be days of sorrow—that sorrow       which is the most lasting of impressions, as the cypress is the       most enduring of trees. For the hours of thy happiness are over       and joy is not gathered twice in a life, as the roses of Paestum       twice in a year. Thou shalt no longer, then, play the Teian with       time, but, being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine, thou shalt       bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth, as do the Moslemin       at Mecca.”        “Morella!” I cried, “Morella! how knowest thou this?” but she       turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming       over her limbs, she thus died, and I heard her voice no more.        Yet, as she had foretold, her child, to which in dying she had       given birth, which breathed not until the mother breathed no       more, her child, a daughter, lived. And she grew strangely in       stature and intellect, and was the perfect resemblance of her who       had departed, and I loved her with a love more fervent than I had       believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth.        But, ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened,       and gloom, and horror, and grief swept over it in clouds. I said       the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence. Strange,       indeed, was her rapid increase in bodily size—but terrible, oh!       terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while       watching the development of her mental being. Could it be       otherwise, when I daily discovered in the conceptions of the       child the adult powers and faculties of the woman?—when the       lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy? and when the       wisdom or the passions of maturity I found hourly gleaming from       its full and speculative eye? When, I say, all this became       evident to my appalled senses—when I could no longer hide it from       my soul, nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled       to receive it—is it to be wondered at that suspicions, of a       nature fearful and exciting, crept in upon my spirit, or that my       thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling       theories of the entombed Morella? I snatched from the scrutiny of       the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore, and in the       rigorous seclusion of my home, watched with an agonizing anxiety       over all which concerned the beloved.        And as years rolled away, and I gazed day after day upon her       holy, and mild, and eloquent face, and poured over her maturing       form, day after day did I discover new points of resemblance in       the child to her mother, the melancholy and the dead. And hourly       grew darker these shadows of similitude, and more full, and more       definite, and more perplexing, and more hideously terrible in       their aspect. For that her smile was like her mother’s I could       bear; but then I shuddered at its too perfect _identity_—that her       eyes were like Morella’s I could endure; but then they, too,       often looked down into the depths of my soul with Morella’s own       intense and bewildering meaning. And in the contour of the high       forehead, and in the ringlets of the silken hair, and in the wan       fingers which buried themselves therein, and in the sad musical       tones of her speech, and above all—oh! above all—in the phrases       and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the       living, I found food for consuming thought and horror—for a worm       that _would_ not die.        Thus passed away two lustra of her life, and as yet my daughter       remained nameless upon the earth. “My child,” and “my love,” were       the designations usually prompted by a father’s affection, and       the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse.       Morella’s name died with her at her death. Of the mother I had       never spoken to the daughter;—it was impossible to speak. Indeed,       during the brief period of her existence, the latter had received       no impressions from the outward world, save such as might have       been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy. But at length       the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind, in its unnerved and       agitated condition, a present deliverance from the terrors of my       destiny. And at the baptismal font I hesitated for a name. And       many titles of the wise and beautiful, of old and modern times,       of my own and foreign lands, came thronging to my lips, with       many, many fair titles of the gentle, and the happy, and the       good. What prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried       dead? What demon urged me to breathe that sound, which in its       very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in       torrents from the temples to the heart? What fiend spoke from the       recesses of my soul, when amid those dim aisles, and in the       silence of the night, I whispered within the ears of the holy man       the syllables—Morella? What more than fiend convulsed the       features of my child, and overspread them with hues of death, as       starting at that scarcely audible sound, she turned her glassy       eyes from the earth to heaven, and falling prostrate on the black       slabs of our ancestral vault, responded—“I am here!”        Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell those few simple sounds       within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into       my brain. Years—years may pass away, but the memory of that       epoch—never! Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the       vine—but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and       day. And I kept no reckoning of time or place, and the stars of       my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and       its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them       all I beheld only—Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed       but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea       murmured evermore—Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I       bore her to the tomb; and I laughed with a long and bitter laugh       as I found no traces of the first in the charnel where I laid the       second, Morella.     A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS         During the fall of the year 1827, while residing near       Charlottesville, Virginia, I casually made the acquaintance of       Mr. Augustus Bedloe. This young gentleman was remarkable in every       respect, and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity. I       found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his       physical relations. Of his family I could obtain no satisfactory       account. Whence he came, I never ascertained. Even about his       age—although I call him a young gentleman—there was something       which perplexed me in no little degree. He certainly seemed       young—and he made a point of speaking about his youth—yet there       were moments when I should have had little trouble in imagining       him a hundred years of age. But in no regard was he more peculiar       than in his personal appearance. He was singularly tall and thin.       He stooped much. His limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated.       His forehead was broad and low. His complexion was absolutely       bloodless. His mouth was large and flexible, and his teeth were       more wildly uneven, although sound, than I had ever before seen       teeth in a human head. The expression of his smile, however, was       by no means unpleasing, as might be supposed; but it had no       variation whatever. It was one of profound melancholy—of a       phaseless and unceasing gloom. His eyes were abnormally large,       and round like those of a cat. The pupils, too, upon any       accession or diminution of light, underwent contraction or       dilation, just such as is observed in the feline tribe. In       moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost       inconceivable; seeming to emit luminous rays, not of a reflected       but of an intrinsic lustre, as does a candle or the sun; yet       their ordinary condition was so totally vapid, filmy, and dull as       to convey the idea of the eyes of a long-interred corpse.        These peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much       annoyance, and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of       half explanatory, half apologetic strain, which, when I first       heard it, impressed me very painfully. I soon, however, grew       accustomed to it, and my uneasiness wore off. It seemed to be his       design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that,       physically, he had not always been what he was—that a long series       of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more       than usual personal beauty, to that which I saw. For many years       past he had been attended by a physician, named Templeton—an old       gentleman, perhaps seventy years of age—whom he had first       encountered at Saratoga, and from whose attention, while there,       he either received, or fancied that he received, great benefit.       The result was that Bedloe, who was wealthy, had made an       arrangement with Dr. Templeton, by which the latter, in       consideration of a liberal annual allowance, had consented to       devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of       the invalid.        Doctor Templeton had been a traveller in his younger days, and at       Paris had become a convert, in great measure, to the doctrines of       Mesmer. It was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he       had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient; and       this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a       certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the       remedies had been educed. The Doctor, however, like all       enthusiasts, had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his       pupil, and finally so far gained his point as to induce the       sufferer to submit to numerous experiments. By a frequent       repetition of these, a result had arisen, which of late days has       become so common as to attract little or no attention, but which,       at the period of which I write, had very rarely been known in       America. I mean to say, that between Doctor Templeton and Bedloe       there had grown up, little by little, a very distinct and       strongly marked rapport, or magnetic relation. I am not prepared       to assert, however, that this rapport extended beyond the limits       of the simple sleep-producing power, but this power itself had       attained great intensity. At the first attempt to induce the       magnetic somnolency, the mesmerist entirely failed. In the fifth       or sixth he succeeded very partially, and after long continued       effort. Only at the twelfth was the triumph complete. After this       the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the       physician, so that, when I first became acquainted with the two,       sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere       volition of the operator, even when the invalid was unaware of       his presence. It is only now, in the year 1845, when similar       miracles are witnessed daily by thousands, that I dare venture to       record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact.        The temperature of Bedloe was, in the highest degree sensitive,       excitable, enthusiastic. His imagination was singularly vigorous       and creative; and no doubt it derived additional force from the       habitual use of morphine, which he swallowed in great quantity,       and without which he would have found it impossible to exist. It       was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately       after breakfast each morning—or, rather, immediately after a cup       of strong coffee, for he ate nothing in the forenoon—and then set       forth alone, or attended only by a dog, upon a long ramble among       the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and       southward of Charlottesville, and are there dignified by the       title of the Ragged Mountains.        Upon a dim, warm, misty day, toward the close of November, and       during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in America is       termed the Indian Summer, Mr. Bedloe departed as usual for the       hills. The day passed, and still he did not return.        About eight o’clock at night, having become seriously alarmed at       his protracted absence, we were about setting out in search of       him, when he unexpectedly made his appearance, in health no worse       than usual, and in rather more than ordinary spirits. The account       which he gave of his expedition, and of the events which had       detained him, was a singular one indeed.        “You will remember,” said he, “that it was about nine in the       morning when I left Charlottesville. I bent my steps immediately       to the mountains, and, about ten, entered a gorge which was       entirely new to me. I followed the windings of this pass with       much interest. The scenery which presented itself on all sides,       although scarcely entitled to be called grand, had about it an       indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation.       The solitude seemed absolutely virgin. I could not help believing       that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which I trod had been       trodden never before by the foot of a human being. So entirely       secluded, and in fact inaccessible, except through a series of       accidents, is the entrance of the ravine, that it is by no means       impossible that I was indeed the first adventurer—the very first       and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses.        “The thick and peculiar mist, or smoke, which distinguishes the       Indian Summer, and which now hung heavily over all objects,       served, no doubt, to deepen the vague impressions which these       objects created. So dense was this pleasant fog that I could at       no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me. This       path was excessively sinuous, and as the sun could not be seen, I       soon lost all idea of the direction in which I journeyed. In the       meantime the morphine had its customary effect—that of enduing       all the external world with an intensity of interest. In the       quivering of a leaf—in the hue of a blade of grass—in the shape       of a trefoil—in the humming of a bee—in the gleaming of a       dew-drop—in the breathing of the wind—in the faint odors that       came from the forest—there came a whole universe of suggestion—a       gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought.        “Busied in this, I walked on for several hours, during which the       mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length I       was reduced to an absolute groping of the way. And now an       indescribable uneasiness possessed me—a species of nervous       hesitation and tremor. I feared to tread, lest I should be       precipitated into some abyss. I remembered, too, strange stories       told about these Ragged Hills, and of the uncouth and fierce       races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns. A thousand       vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me—fancies the more       distressing because vague. Very suddenly my attention was       arrested by the loud beating of a drum.        “My amazement was, of course, extreme. A drum in these hills was       a thing unknown. I could not have been more surprised at the       sound of the trump of the Archangel. But a new and still more       astounding source of interest and perplexity arose. There came a       wild rattling or jingling sound, as if of a bunch of large keys,       and upon the instant a dusky-visaged and half-naked man rushed       past me with a shriek. He came so close to my person that I felt       his hot breath upon my face. He bore in one hand an instrument       composed of an assemblage of steel rings, and shook them       vigorously as he ran. Scarcely had he disappeared in the mist       before, panting after him, with open mouth and glaring eyes,       there darted a huge beast. I could not be mistaken in its       character. It was a hyena.        “The sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my       terrors—for I now made sure that I dreamed, and endeavored to       arouse myself to waking consciousness. I stepped boldly and       briskly forward. I rubbed my eyes. I called aloud. I pinched my       limbs. A small spring of water presented itself to my view, and       here, stooping, I bathed my hands and my head and neck. This       seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto       annoyed me. I arose, as I thought, a new man, and proceeded       steadily and complacently on my unknown way.        “At length, quite overcome by exertion, and by a certain       oppressive closeness of the atmosphere, I seated myself beneath a       tree. Presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine, and the       shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon       the grass. At this shadow I gazed wonderingly for many minutes.       Its character stupefied me with astonishment. I looked upward.       The tree was a palm.        “I now arose hurriedly, and in a state of fearful agitation—for       the fancy that I dreamed would serve me no longer. I saw—I felt       that I had perfect command of my senses—and these senses now       brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation. The       heat became all at once intolerable. A strange odor loaded the       breeze. A low, continuous murmur, like that arising from a full,       but gently flowing river, came to my ears, intermingled with the       peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices.        “While I listened in an extremity of astonishment which I need       not attempt to describe, a strong and brief gust of wind bore off       the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter.        “I found myself at the foot of a high mountain, and looking down       into a vast plain, through which wound a majestic river. On the       margin of this river stood an Eastern-looking city, such as we       read of in the Arabian Tales, but of a character even more       singular than any there described. From my position, which was       far above the level of the town, I could perceive its every nook       and corner, as if delineated on a map. The streets seemed       innumerable, and crossed each other irregularly in all       directions, but were rather long winding alleys than streets, and       absolutely swarmed with inhabitants. The houses were wildly       picturesque. On every hand was a wilderness of balconies, of       verandas, of minarets, of shrines, and fantastically carved       oriels. Bazaars abounded; and in these were displayed rich wares       in infinite variety and profusion—silks, muslins, the most       dazzling cutlery, the most magnificent jewels and gems. Besides       these things, were seen, on all sides, banners and palanquins,       litters with stately dames close-veiled, elephants gorgeously       caparisoned, idols grotesquely hewn, drums, banners, and gongs,       spears, silver and gilded maces. And amid the crowd, and the       clamor, and the general intricacy and confusion—amid the million       of black and yellow men, turbaned and robed, and of flowing       beard, there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls,       while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered,       chattering and shrieking, about the cornices of the mosques, or       clung to the minarets and oriels. From the swarming streets to       the banks of the river, there descended innumerable flights of       steps leading to bathing places, while the river itself seemed to       force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of       deeply-burthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface.       Beyond the limits of the city arose, in frequent majestic groups,       the palm and the cocoa, with other gigantic and weird trees of       vast age; and here and there might be seen a field of rice, the       thatched hut of a peasant, a tank, a stray temple, a gypsy camp,       or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way, with a pitcher upon       her head, to the banks of the magnificent river.        “You will say now, of course, that I dreamed; but not so. What I       saw—what I heard—what I felt—what I thought—had about it nothing       of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream. All was rigorously       self-consistent. At first, doubting that I was really awake, I       entered into a series of tests, which soon convinced me that I       really was. Now, when one dreams, and, in the dream, suspects       that he dreams, the suspicion never fails to confirm itself, and       the sleeper is almost immediately aroused. Thus Novalis errs not       in saying that ‘we are near waking when we dream that we dream.’       Had the vision occurred to me as I describe it, without my       suspecting it as a dream, then a dream it might absolutely have       been, but, occurring as it did, and suspected and tested as it       was, I am forced to class it among other phenomena.”        “In this I am not sure that you are wrong,” observed Dr.       Templeton, “but proceed. You arose and descended into the city.”        “I arose,” continued Bedloe, regarding the Doctor with an air of       profound astonishment “I arose, as you say, and descended into       the city. On my way I fell in with an immense populace, crowding       through every avenue, all in the same direction, and exhibiting       in every action the wildest excitement. Very suddenly, and by       some inconceivable impulse, I became intensely imbued with       personal interest in what was going on. I seemed to feel that I       had an important part to play, without exactly understanding what       it was. Against the crowd which environed me, however, I       experienced a deep sentiment of animosity. I shrank from amid       them, and, swiftly, by a circuitous path, reached and entered the       city. Here all was the wildest tumult and contention. A small       party of men, clad in garments half Indian, half European, and       officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly British, were engaged,       at great odds, with the swarming rabble of the alleys. I joined       the weaker party, arming myself with the weapons of a fallen       officer, and fighting I knew not whom with the nervous ferocity       of despair. We were soon overpowered by numbers, and driven to       seek refuge in a species of kiosk. Here we barricaded ourselves,       and, for the present were secure. From a loop-hole near the       summit of the kiosk, I perceived a vast crowd, in furious       agitation, surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung       the river. Presently, from an upper window of this place, there       descended an effeminate-looking person, by means of a string made       of the turbans of his attendants. A boat was at hand, in which he       escaped to the opposite bank of the river.        “And now a new object took possession of my soul. I spoke a few       hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having       succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a       frantic sally from the kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that       surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before us. They rallied,       fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we were borne       far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the       narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of       which the sun had never been able to shine. The rabble pressed       impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and       overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very       remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of       the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping       serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of       them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An       instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled—I       gasped—I died.”         “You will hardly persist _now_,” said I smiling, “that the whole        of your adventure was not a dream. You are not prepared to        maintain that you are dead?”        When I said these words, I of course expected some lively sally       from Bedloe in reply, but, to my astonishment, he hesitated,       trembled, became fearfully pallid, and remained silent. I looked       toward Templeton. He sat erect and rigid in his chair—his teeth       chattered, and his eyes were starting from their sockets.       “Proceed!” he at length said hoarsely to Bedloe.        “For many minutes,” continued the latter, “my sole sentiment—my       sole feeling—was that of darkness and nonentity, with the       consciousness of death. At length there seemed to pass a violent       and sudden shock through my soul, as if of electricity. With it       came the sense of elasticity and of light. This latter I felt—not       saw. In an instant I seemed to rise from the ground. But I had no       bodily, no visible, audible, or palpable presence. The crowd had       departed. The tumult had ceased. The city was in comparative       repose. Beneath me lay my corpse, with the arrow in my temple,       the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured. But all these       things I felt—not saw. I took interest in nothing. Even the       corpse seemed a matter in which I had no concern. Volition I had       none, but appeared to be impelled into motion, and flitted       buoyantly out of the city, retracing the circuitous path by which       I had entered it. When I had attained that point of the ravine in       the mountains at which I had encountered the hyena, I again       experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery; the sense of       weight, of volition, of substance, returned. I became my original       self, and bent my steps eagerly homeward—but the past had not       lost the vividness of the real—and not now, even for an instant,       can I compel my understanding to regard it as a dream.”        “Nor was it,” said Templeton, with an air of deep solemnity, “yet       it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed.       Let us suppose only, that the soul of the man of to-day is upon       the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries. Let us content       ourselves with this supposition. For the rest I have some       explanation to make. Here is a watercolor drawing, which I should       have shown you before, but which an unaccountable sentiment of       horror has hitherto prevented me from showing.”        We looked at the picture which he presented. I saw nothing in it       of an extraordinary character, but its effect upon Bedloe was       prodigious. He nearly fainted as he gazed. And yet it was but a       miniature portrait—a miraculously accurate one, to be sure—of his       own very remarkable features. At least this was my thought as I       regarded it.        “You will perceive,” said Templeton, “the date of this picture—it       is here, scarcely visible, in this corner—1780. In this year was       the portrait taken. It is the likeness of a dead friend—a Mr.       Oldeb—to whom I became much attached at Calcutta, during the       administration of Warren Hastings. I was then only twenty years       old. When I first saw you, Mr. Bedloe, at Saratoga, it was the       miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the       painting which induced me to accost you, to seek your friendship,       and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my       becoming your constant companion. In accomplishing this point, I       was urged partly, and perhaps principally, by a regretful memory       of the deceased, but also, in part, by an uneasy, and not       altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself.        “In your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid       the hills, you have described, with the minutest accuracy, the       Indian city of Benares, upon the Holy River. The riots, the       combat, the massacre, were the actual events of the insurrection       of Cheyte Sing, which took place in 1780, when Hastings was put       in imminent peril of his life. The man escaping by the string of       turbans was Cheyte Sing himself. The party in the kiosk were       sepoys and British officers, headed by Hastings. Of this party I       was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally       of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned       arrow of a Bengalee. That officer was my dearest friend. It was       Oldeb. You will perceive by these manuscripts,” (here the speaker       produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been       freshly written,) “that at the very period in which you fancied       these things amid the hills, I was engaged in detailing them upon       paper here at home.”        In about a week after this conversation, the following paragraphs       appeared in a Charlottesville paper:        “We have the painful duty of announcing the death of Mr. Augustus       Bedlo, a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have       long endeared him to the citizens of Charlottesville.        “Mr. B., for some years past, has been subject to neuralgia,       which has often threatened to terminate fatally; but this can be       regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate       cause was one of especial singularity. In an excursion to the       Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were       contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the       head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical       bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a fearfully       brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar       containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of       the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in       the neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small       artery in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the       medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too       late.        “N. B.—The poisonous sangsue of Charlottesville may always be       distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness, and       especially by its writhing or vermicular motions, which very       nearly resemble those of a snake.”        I was speaking with the editor of the paper in question, upon the       topic of this remarkable accident, when it occurred to me to ask       how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as       Bedlo.        “I presume,” I said, “you have authority for this spelling, but I       have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the       end.”        “Authority?—no,” he replied. “It is a mere typographical error.       The name is Bedlo with an e, all the world over, and I never knew       it to be spelt otherwise in my life.”        “Then,” said I mutteringly, as I turned upon my heel, “then       indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any       fiction—for Bedloe, without the e, what is it but Oldeb       conversed! And this man tells me that it is a typographical       error.”     THE SPECTACLES         Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of “love       at first sight;” but those who think, not less than those who       feel deeply, have always advocated its existence. Modern       discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or       magnetoesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, and,       consequently, the truest and most intense of the human affections       are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy—in       a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal       fetters are those which are riveted by a glance. The confession I       am about to make will add another to the already almost       innumerable instances of the truth of the position.        My story requires that I should be somewhat minute. I am still a       very young man—not yet twenty-two years of age. My name, at       present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one—Simpson. I say       “at present;” for it is only lately that I have been so       called—having legislatively adopted this surname within the last       year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant       male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq. The bequest was conditioned       upon my taking the name of the testator,—the family, not the       Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte—or, more       properly, these are my first and middle appellations.        I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my true       patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride—believing       that I could trace a descent from the immortal author of the       “Chronicles.” While on the subject of names, by the bye, I may       mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of       some of my immediate predecessors. My father was a Monsieur       Froissart, of Paris. His wife—my mother, whom he married at       fifteen—was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of       Croissart the banker, whose wife, again, being only sixteen when       married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. Monsieur       Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar name—a       Mademoiselle Moissart. She, too, was quite a child when married;       and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen when led       to the altar. These early marriages are usual in France. Here,       however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and Froissart, all in       the direct line of descent. My own name, though, as I say, became       Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my       part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting       the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.        As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient. On the       contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what nine       tenths of the world would call a handsome face. In height I am       five feet eleven. My hair is black and curling. My nose is       sufficiently good. My eyes are large and gray; and although, in       fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree, still no defect       in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. The       weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I have       resorted to every remedy—short of wearing glasses. Being youthful       and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have resolutely       refused to employ them. I know nothing, indeed, which so       disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses       every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of       sanctimoniousness and of age. An eyeglass, on the other hand, has       a savor of downright foppery and affectation. I have hitherto       managed as well as I could without either. But something too much       of these merely personal details, which, after all, are of little       importance. I will content myself with saying, in addition, that       my temperament is sanguine, rash, ardent, enthusiastic—and that       all my life I have been a devoted admirer of the women.        One night last winter I entered a box at the P—— Theatre, in       company with a friend, Mr. Talbot. It was an opera night, and the       bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was       excessively crowded. We were in time, however, to obtain the       front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with       some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.        For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave his       undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I amused       myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in chief part,       of the very elite of the city. Having satisfied myself upon this       point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima donna, when they       were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes       which had escaped my observation.        If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the intense       emotion with which I regarded this figure. It was that of a       female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld. The face was so far       turned toward the stage that, for some minutes, I could not       obtain a view of it—but the form was divine; no other word can       sufficiently express its magnificent proportion—and even the term       “divine” seems ridiculously feeble as I write it.        The magic of a lovely form in woman—the necromancy of female       gracefulness—was always a power which I had found it impossible       to resist, but here was grace personified, incarnate, the beau       ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions. The figure,       almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be       seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly       approached, without positively reaching, the majestic. Its       perfect fullness and tournure were delicious. The head, of which       only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek       Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap       of _gaze äérienne_, which put me in mind of the _ventum textilem_       of Apuleius. The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box,       and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry.       Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves       now in fashion. This extended but little below the elbow. Beneath       it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting,       and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell gracefully over       the top of the hand, revealing only the delicate fingers, upon       one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at once saw was of       extraordinary value. The admirable roundness of the wrist was       well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and which also was       ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of       jewels—telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once of       the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer.        I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour, as       if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during this       period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been said       or sung concerning “love at first sight.” My feelings were       totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in       the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female       loveliness. An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to consider       a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, not only       my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, upon the       admirable object before me. I saw—I felt—I knew that I was       deeply, madly, irrevocably in love—and this even before seeing       the face of the person beloved. So intense, indeed, was the       passion that consumed me, that I really believe it would have       received little if any abatement had the features, yet unseen,       proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is the nature       of the only true love—of the love at first sight—and so little       really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only       seem to create and control it.        While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision, a       sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head       partially toward me, so that I beheld the entire profile of the       face. Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations—and yet there was       something about it which disappointed me without my being able to       tell exactly what it was. I said “disappointed,” but this is not       altogether the word. My sentiments were at once quieted and       exalted. They partook less of transport and more of calm       enthusiasm—of enthusiastic repose. This state of feeling arose,       perhaps, from the Madonna-like and matronly air of the face; and       yet I at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely       from this. There was something else—some mystery which I could       not develope—some expression about the countenance which slightly       disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest. In fact, I       was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and       susceptible man for any act of extravagance. Had the lady been       alone, I should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her       at all hazards; but, fortunately, she was attended by two       companions—a gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all       appearance a few years younger than herself.        I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might obtain,       hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the       present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty. I       would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the       crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the       stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited       the use of the opera-glass in a case such as this, even had I       been so fortunate as to have one with me—but I had not—and was       thus in despair.        At length I bethought me of applying to my companion.        “Talbot,” I said, “you have an opera-glass. Let me have it.”        “An opera-glass!—no!—what do you suppose I would be doing with an       opera-glass?” Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.        “But, Talbot,” I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, “listen       to me will you? Do you see the stage-box?—there!—no, the next.—       Did you ever behold as lovely a woman?”        “She is very beautiful, no doubt,” he said.        “I wonder who she can be?”        “Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don’t you know who she       is? ‘Not to know her argues yourself unknown.’ She is the       celebrated Madame Lalande—the beauty of the day par excellence,       and the talk of the whole town. Immensely wealthy too—a widow,       and a great match—has just arrived from Paris.”        “Do you know her?”        “Yes; I have the honor.”        “Will you introduce me?”        “Assuredly, with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?”        “To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B—’s.”        “Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.”        In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot’s advice; for       he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or       suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the       evening with what was transacting upon the stage.        In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, and at       length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her       face. It was exquisitely lovely—this, of course, my heart had       told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon the       point—but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. I       finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air       of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, which       took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance,       only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty, and       thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment, with       an interest tenfold.        While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my great       trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the       lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my       gaze. Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not withdraw       it, even for an instant. She turned aside her face, and again I       saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head.       After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I was       still looking, she gradually brought her face again around and       again encountered my burning gaze. Her large dark eyes fell       instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek. But what was my       astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second       time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a       double eyeglass—elevated it—adjusted it—and then regarded me       through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several       minutes.        Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been more       thoroughly astounded—astounded only—not offended or disgusted in       the slightest degree; although an action so bold in any other       woman would have been likely to offend or disgust. But the whole       thing was done with so much quietude—so much nonchalance—so much       repose—with so evident an air of the highest breeding, in       short—that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible, and my       sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise.        I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she had       seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, and       was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a second       thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me with fixed       attention for the space of several minutes—for five minutes, at       the very least, I am sure.        This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted very       general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite movement, or       buzz, among the audience, which for a moment filled me with       confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of       Madame Lalande.        Having satisfied her curiosity—if such it was—she dropped the       glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her       profile now being turned toward myself, as before. I continued to       watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my       rudeness in so doing. Presently I saw the head slowly and       slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that       the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact,       attentively regarding myself. It is needless to say what effect       this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my       excitable mind.        Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, the       fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended       her, and while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the glances of       both, that the conversation had reference to myself.        Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned toward the       stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the       performance. At the expiration of this period, however, I was       thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for       the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully       confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the       audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous       composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my       soul.        This extraordinary behavior, by throwing me into a perfect fever       of excitement—into an absolute delirium of love—served rather to       embolden than to disconcert me. In the mad intensity of my       devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the majestic       loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. Watching my       opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully engaged with       the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame Lalande, and,       upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable bow.        She blushed very deeply—then averted her eyes—then slowly and       cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action had       been noticed—then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her       side.        I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had committed,       and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while a vision       of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably       through my brain. I was greatly and immediately relieved,       however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a       play-bill, without speaking; but the reader may form some feeble       conception of my astonishment—of my profound amazement—my       delirious bewilderment of heart and soul—when, instantly       afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her       bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with       a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth, made       two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations       of the head.        It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy—upon my       transport—upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart. If ever man was       mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment. I       loved. This was my first love—so I felt it to be. It was love       supreme—indescribable. It was “love at first sight;” and at first       sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned.        Yes, returned. How and why should I doubt it for an instant. What       other construction could I possibly put upon such conduct, on the       part of a lady so beautiful—so wealthy—evidently so       accomplished—of so high breeding—of so lofty a position in       society—in every regard so entirely respectable as I felt assured       was Madame Lalande? Yes, she loved me—she returned the enthusiasm       of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind—as uncompromising—as       uncalculating—as abandoned—and as utterly unbounded as my own!       These delicious fancies and reflections, however, were now       interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. The audience       arose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. Quitting       Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way into closer       proximity with Madame Lalande. Having failed in this, on account       of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and bent my steps       homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having       been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the reflection       that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, upon the       morrow.        This morrow at last came, that is to say, a day finally dawned       upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the hours       until “one” were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable. But even       Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an end to       this long delay. The clock struck. As the last echo ceased, I       stepped into B——’s and inquired for Talbot.        “Out,” said the footman—Talbot’s own.        “Out!” I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces—“let me tell       you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly impossible and       impracticable; Mr. Talbot is not out. What do you mean?”        “Nothing, sir; only Mr. Talbot is not in, that’s all. He rode       over to S——, immediately after breakfast, and left word that he       would not be in town again for a week.”        I stood petrified with horror and rage. I endeavored to reply,       but my tongue refused its office. At length I turned on my heel,       livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the       Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus. It was evident that       my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite forgotten his       appointment with myself—had forgotten it as soon as it was made.       At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word. There was no       help for it; so smothering my vexation as well as I could, I       strolled moodily up the street, propounding futile inquiries       about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance I met. By report       she was known, I found, to all—to many by sight—but she had been       in town only a few weeks, and there were very few, therefore, who       claimed her personal acquaintance. These few, being still       comparatively strangers, could not, or would not, take the       liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning       call. While I stood thus in despair, conversing with a trio of       friends upon the all-absorbing subject of my heart, it so       happened that the subject itself passed by.        “As I live, there she is!” cried one.        “Surprisingly beautiful!” exclaimed a second.        “An angel upon earth!” ejaculated a third.        I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, passing       slowly down the street, sat the enchanting vision of the opera,       accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her       box.        “Her companion also wears remarkably well,” said the one of my       trio who had spoken first.        “Astonishingly,” said the second; “still quite a brilliant air,       but art will do wonders. Upon my word, she looks better than she       did at Paris five years ago. A beautiful woman still;—don’t you       think so, Froissart?—Simpson, I mean.”        “_Still!_” said I, “and why shouldn’t she be? But compared with       her friend she is as a rush-light to the evening star—a glow-worm       to Antares.”        “Ha! ha! ha!—why, Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at making       discoveries—original ones, I mean.” And here we separated, while       one of the trio began humming a gay _vaudeville_, of which I       caught only the lines—        Ninon, Ninon, Ninon à bas—       A bas Ninon De L’Enclos!        During this little scene, however, one thing had served greatly       to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was       consumed. As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group,       I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, she       had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles,       with no equivocal mark of the recognition.        As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of it       until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from the       country. In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every       reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the       theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of       meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again. This       did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight. Every       day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and       every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the       everlasting “Not come home yet” of his footman.        Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a condition       little short of madness. Madame Lalande, I had been told, was a       Parisian—had lately arrived from Paris—might she not suddenly       return?—return before Talbot came back—and might she not be thus       lost to me forever? The thought was too terrible to bear. Since       my future happiness was at issue, I resolved to act with a manly       decision. In a word, upon the breaking up of the play, I traced       the lady to her residence, noted the address, and the next       morning sent her a full and elaborate letter, in which I poured       out my whole heart.        I spoke boldly, freely—in a word, I spoke with passion. I       concealed nothing—nothing even of my weakness. I alluded to the       romantic circumstances of our first meeting—even to the glances       which had passed between us. I went so far as to say that I felt       assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own       intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise       unpardonable conduct. As a third, I spoke of my fear that she       might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a       formal introduction. I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic       epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly       circumstances—of my affluence—and with an offer of my heart and       of my hand.        In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply. After what seemed       the lapse of a century it came.        Yes, actually came. Romantic as all this may appear, I really       received a letter from Madame Lalande—the beautiful, the wealthy,       the idolized Madame Lalande. Her eyes—her magnificent eyes, had       not belied her noble heart. Like a true Frenchwoman as she was       she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason—the generous       impulses of her nature—despising the conventional pruderies of       the world. She had not scorned my proposals. She had not       sheltered herself in silence. She had not returned my letter       unopened. She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by her own       exquisite fingers. It ran thus:        “Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle       tong of his contrée so vell as might. It is only de late dat I am       arrive, and not yet ave do opportunité for to—l’étudier.        “Vid dis apologie for the manière, I vill now say dat,       hélas!—Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true. Need I say de       more? Hélas! am I not ready speak de too moshe?        “EUGENIE LALAND.”        This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and committed,       no doubt, on its account, a thousand other extravagances that       have now escaped my memory. Still Talbot _would_ not return.       Alas! could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering       his absence had occasioned his friend, would not his sympathizing       nature have flown immediately to my relief? Still, however, he       came _not_. I wrote. He replied. He was detained by urgent       business—but would shortly return. He begged me not to be       impatient—to moderate my transports—to read soothing books—to       drink nothing stronger than Hock—and to bring the consolations of       philosophy to my aid. The fool! if he could not come himself,       why, in the name of every thing rational, could he not have       enclosed me a letter of presentation? I wrote him again,       entreating him to forward one forthwith. My letter was returned       by _that_ footman, with the following endorsement in pencil. The       scoundrel had joined his master in the country:        “Left S—— yesterday, for parts unknown—did not say where—or when       be back—so thought best to return letter, knowing your       handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry.        “Yours sincerely,        “STUBBS.”        After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the infernal       deities both master and valet:—but there was little use in anger,       and no consolation at all in complaint.        But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional audacity.       Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to make it       avail me to the end. Besides, after the correspondence which had       passed between us, what act of mere informality could I commit,       within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by Madame       Lalande? Since the affair of the letter, I had been in the habit       of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about twilight,       it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a negro in       livery, in a public square overlooked by her windows. Here, amid       the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the gray gloom of a sweet       midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and accosted her.        The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this with       the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance. With a       presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and,       to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands. The       valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to       overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love.        As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she wrote       it, our conversation was necessarily in French. In this sweet       tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the impetuous       enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I could       command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage.        At this impatience she smiled. She urged the old story of       decorum—that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the       opportunity for bliss has forever gone by. I had most imprudently       made it known among my friends, she observed, that I desired her       acquaintance—thus that I did not possess it—thus, again, there       was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge       of each other. And then she adverted, with a blush, to the       extreme recency of this date. To wed immediately would be       improper—would be indecorous—would be outre. All this she said       with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved       and convinced me. She went even so far as to accuse me,       laughingly, of rashness—of imprudence. She bade me remember that       I really even knew not who she was—what were her prospects, her       connections, her standing in society. She begged me, but with a       sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an       infatuation—a will o’ the wisp—a fancy or fantasy of the moment—a       baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of       the heart. These things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet       twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us—and then, with       a gentle pressure of her fairy-like hand, overthrew, in a single       sweet instant, all the argumentative fabric she had reared.        I replied as best I could—as only a true lover can. I spoke at       length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion—of her       exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. In       conclusion, I dwelt, with a convincing energy, upon the perils       that encompass the course of love—that course of true love that       never did run smooth—and thus deduced the manifest danger of       rendering that course unnecessarily long.        This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her       determination. She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, she       said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. This       was a delicate point—for a woman to urge, especially so; in       mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her       feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made. She       alluded to the topic of age. Was I aware—was I fully aware of the       discrepancy between us? That the age of the husband, should       surpass by a few years—even by fifteen or twenty—the age of the       wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and, indeed, as       even proper; but she had always entertained the belief that the       years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the       husband. A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too       frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness. Now she was aware       that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the       contrary, perhaps, was not aware that the years of my Eugénie       extended very considerably beyond that sum.        About all this there was a nobility of soul—a dignity of       candor—which delighted—which enchanted me—which eternally riveted       my chains. I could scarcely restrain the excessive transport       which possessed me.        “My sweetest Eugénie,” I cried, “what is all this about which you       are discoursing? Your years surpass in some measure my own. But       what then? The customs of the world are so many conventional       follies. To those who love as ourselves, in what respect differs       a year from an hour? I am twenty-two, you say; granted: indeed,       you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. Now you yourself,       my dearest Eugénie, can have numbered no more than—can have       numbered no more than—no more than—than—than—than—”        Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame       Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age. But a       Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answer to       an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. In       the present instance, Eugénie, who for a few moments past had       seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let       fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up       and presented to her.        “Keep it!” she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. “Keep       it for my sake—for the sake of her whom it too flatteringly       represents. Besides, upon the back of the trinket you may       discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to desire. It is       now, to be sure, growing rather dark—but you can examine it at       your leisure in the morning. In the meantime, you shall be my       escort home to-night. My friends are about holding a little       musical _levée_. I can promise you, too, some good singing. We       French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I       shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of       an old acquaintance.”        With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home. The mansion       was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good taste. Of       this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to judge; for       it was just dark as we arrived; and in American mansions of the       better sort lights seldom, during the heat of summer, make their       appearance at this, the most pleasant period of the day. In about       an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a single shaded solar lamp       was lit in the principal drawing-room; and this apartment, I       could thus see, was arranged with unusual good taste and even       splendor; but two other rooms of the suite, and in which the       company chiefly assembled, remained, during the whole evening, in       a very agreeable shadow. This is a well-conceived custom, giving       the party at least a choice of light or shade, and one which our       friends over the water could not do better than immediately       adopt.        The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of       my life. Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical abilities       of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had never heard       excelled in any private circle out of Vienna. The instrumental       performers were many and of superior talents. The vocalists were       chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than well. At length,       upon a peremptory call for “Madame Lalande,” she arose at once,       without affectation or demur, from the chaise longue upon which       she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one or two gentlemen       and her female friend of the opera, repaired to the piano in the       main drawing-room. I would have escorted her myself, but felt       that, under the circumstances of my introduction to the house, I       had better remain unobserved where I was. I was thus deprived of       the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, her sing.        The impression she produced upon the company seemed       electrical—but the effect upon myself was something even more. I       know not how adequately to describe it. It arose in part, no       doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; but       chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the       singer. It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or       recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers. Her       utterance of the romance in Otello—the tone with which she gave       the words “Sul mio sasso,” in the Capuletti—is ringing in my       memory yet. Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous. Her voice       embraced three complete octaves, extending from the contralto D       to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently powerful to have       filled the San Carlos, executed, with the minutest precision,       every difficulty of vocal composition—ascending and descending       scales, cadences, or fiorituri. In the final of the Somnambula,       she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words:       Ah! non guinge uman pensiero      Al contento ond ’io son piena.        Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original phrase       of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, when,       by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble stave,       springing over an interval of two octaves.        Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal       execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to       her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her       performance. Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most       unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a       certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation,       had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not       acquit herself with any remarkable ability.        Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and       totally unreserved. She made me relate many of the earlier       passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to       every word of the narrative. I concealed nothing—felt that I had       a right to conceal nothing—from her confiding affection.       Encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age, I       entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my       many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and       even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in       demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an       evidence of love. I touched upon my college indiscretions—upon my       extravagances—upon my carousals—upon my debts—upon my       flirtations. I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic       cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled—of a chronic       rheumatism—of a twinge of hereditary gout—and, in conclusion, of       the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully       concealed, weakness of my eyes.        “Upon this latter point,” said Madame Lalande, laughingly, “you       have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for,       without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would       have accused you of the crime. By the by,” she continued, “have       you any recollection—” and here I fancied that a blush, even       through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible       upon her cheek—“have you any recollection, _mon cher ami_, of       this little ocular assistant, which now depends from my neck?”        As she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double       eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the       opera.        “Full well—alas! do I remember it,” I exclaimed, pressing       passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my       inspection. They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly       chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels, which, even in       the deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high       value.        “_Eh bien! mon ami_,” she resumed with a certain _empressment_ of       manner that rather surprised me—“_Eh bien! mon ami_, you have       earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to       denominate priceless. You have demanded of me my hand upon the       morrow. Should I yield to your entreaties—and, I may add, to the       pleadings of my own bosom—would I not be entitled to demand of       you a very—a very little boon in return?”        “Name it!” I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon       us the observation of the company, and restrained by their       presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet.       “Name it, my beloved, my Eugénie, my own!—name it!—but, alas! it       is already yielded ere named.”        “You shall conquer, then, _mon ami_,” said she, “for the sake of       the Eugénie whom you love, this little weakness which you have at       last confessed—this weakness more moral than physical—and which,       let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your real       nature—so inconsistent with the candor of your usual       character—and which, if permitted further control, will assuredly       involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable scrape.       You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which leads you,       as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied denial of       your infirmity of vision. For, this infirmity you virtually deny,       in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief. You       will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to wear       spectacles;—ah, hush!—you have already consented to wear them,       for my sake. You shall accept the little toy which I now hold in       my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, is       really of no very immense value as a gem. You perceive that, by a       trifling modification thus—or thus—it can be adapted to the eyes       in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an       eye-glass. It is in the former mode, however, and habitually,       that you have already consented to wear it for my sake.”        This request—must I confess it?—confused me in no little degree.       But the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation,       of course, a matter altogether out of the question.        “It is done!” I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could       muster at the moment. “It is done—it is most cheerfully agreed. I       sacrifice every feeling for your sake. To-night I wear this dear       eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the       earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of       calling you wife, I will place it upon my—upon my nose,—and there       wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less       fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form which       you desire.”        Our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements       for the morrow. Talbot, I learned from my betrothed, had just       arrived in town. I was to see him at once, and procure a       carriage. The _soirée_ would scarcely break up before two; and by       this hour the vehicle was to be at the door; when, in the       confusion occasioned by the departure of the company, Madame L.       could easily enter it unobserved. We were then to call at the       house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; there be married,       drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to the East; leaving the       fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the       matter it thought best.        Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went in       search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from       stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the       miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. The       countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one! Those large       luminous eyes!—that proud Grecian nose!—those dark luxuriant       curls!—“Ah!” said I, exultingly to myself, “this is indeed the       speaking image of my beloved!” I turned the reverse, and       discovered the words—“Eugénie Lalande—aged twenty-seven years and       seven months.”        I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint him       with my good fortune. He professed excessive astonishment, of       course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered every       assistance in his power. In a word, we carried out our       arrangement to the letter, and, at two in the morning, just ten       minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage       with Madame Lalande—with Mrs. Simpson, I should say—and driving       at a great rate out of town, in a direction northeast by north,       half-north.        It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to be       up all night, we should make our first stop at C——, a village       about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early       breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route. At       four precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of       the principal inn. I handed my adored wife out, and ordered       breakfast forthwith. In the meantime we were shown into a small       parlor, and sat down.        It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I gazed,       enraptured, at the angel by my side, the singular idea came, all       at once, into my head, that this was really the very first moment       since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of Madame       Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness       by daylight at all.        “And now, _mon ami_,” said she, taking my hand, and so       interrupting this train of reflection, “and now, _mon cher ami_,       since we are indissolubly one—since I have yielded to your       passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our       agreement—I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a       little favor to bestow—a little promise which it is your       intention to keep. Ah! let me see! Let me remember! Yes; full       easily do I call to mind the precise words of the dear promise       you made to Eugénie last night. Listen! You spoke thus: ‘It is       done!—it is most cheerfully agreed! I sacrifice every feeling for       your sake. To-night I wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass,       and upon my heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning       which gives me the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it       upon my—upon my nose,—and there wear it ever afterward, in the       less romantic, and less fashionable, but certainly in the more       serviceable, form which you desire.’ These were the exact words,       my beloved husband, were they not?”        “They were,” I said; “you have an excellent memory; and       assuredly, my beautiful Eugénie, there is no disposition on my       part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply.       See! Behold! they are becoming—rather—are they not?” And here,       having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles, I       applied them gingerly in their proper position; while Madame       Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, sat bolt       upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and indeed,       in a somewhat undignified position.        “Goodness gracious me!” I exclaimed, almost at the very instant       that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose—“_My!_       goodness gracious me!—why, what can be the matter with these       glasses?” and taking them quickly off, I wiped them carefully       with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again.        But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something which       occasioned me surprise, in the second, this surprise became       elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was       profound—was extreme—indeed I may say it was horrific. What, in       the name of everything hideous, did this mean? Could I believe my       eyes?—could I?—that was the question. Was that—was that—was that       rouge? And were those—and were those—were those wrinkles, upon       the visage of Eugénie Lalande? And oh! Jupiter, and every one of       the gods and goddesses, little and big!—what—what—what—_what_ had       become of her teeth? I dashed the spectacles violently to the       ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of the       floor, confronting Mrs. Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and       grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless       with terror and with rage.        Now I have already said that Madame Eugénie Lalande—that is to       say, Simpson—spoke the English language but very little better       than she wrote it, and for this reason she very properly never       attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions. But rage will       carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present care it carried       Mrs. Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to       hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether       understand.        “Vell, Monsieur,” said she, after surveying me, in great apparent       astonishment, for some moments—“Vell, Monsieur?—and vat den?—vat       de matter now? Is it de dance of de Saint itusse dat you ave? If       not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in the poke?”        “You wretch!” said I, catching my breath—“you—you—you villainous       old hag!”        “Ag?—ole?—me not so ver ole, after all! Me not one single day       more dan de eighty-doo.”        “Eighty-two!” I ejaculated, staggering to the wall—“eighty-two       hundred thousand baboons! The miniature said twenty-seven years       and seven months!”        “To be sure!—dat is so!—ver true! but den de portraite has been       take for dese fifty-five year. Ven I go marry my segonde usbande,       Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take for my       daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!”        “Moissart!” said I.        “Yes, Moissart,” said she, mimicking my pronunciation, which, to       speak the truth, was none of the best,—“and vat den? Vat you know       about de Moissart?”        “Nothing, you old fright!—I know nothing about him at all; only I       had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.”        “Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name? ’Tis ver _goot_       name; and so is Voissart—dat is ver goot name too. My daughter,       Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart,—and de       name is bot _ver_ respectable name.”        “Moissart?” I exclaimed, “and Voissart! Why, what is it you       mean?”        “Vat I mean?—I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de matter of       dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only tink proper       to mean it. My daughter’s daughter, Mademoiselle Voissart, she       marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den again, my daughter’s grande       daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von Monsieur       Froissart; and I suppose you say dat _dat_ is not von _ver_       respectaable name.”        “Froissart!” said I, beginning to faint, “why, surely you don’t       say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?”        “Yes,” she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and       stretching out her lower limbs at great length; “yes, Moissart,       and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart. But Monsieur       Froissart, he vas von _ver_ big vat you call fool—he vas von ver       great big donce like yourself—for he lef _la belle France_ for       come to dis stupide Amérique—and ven he get here he went and ave       von _ver_ stupid, von _ver, ver_ stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I       not yet av ad de plaisir to meet vid him—neither me nor my       companion, de Madame Stéphanie Lalande. He is name de Napoleon       Bonaparte Froissart, and I suppose you say dat _dat_, too, is not       von ver respectable name.”        Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the effect of       working up Mrs. Simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed;       and as she made an end of it, with great labor, she jumped up       from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping upon the floor       an entire universe of bustle as she jumped. Once upon her feet,       she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled up her sleeves,       shook her fist in my face, and concluded the performance by       tearing the cap from her head, and with it an immense wig of the       most valuable and beautiful black hair, the whole of which she       dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there trammpled and       danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy and agony of       rage.        Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated.       “Moissart and Voissart!” I repeated, thoughtfully, as she cut one       of her pigeon-wings, and “Croissart and Froissart!” as she       completed another—“Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and       Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart!—why, you ineffable old serpent,       that’s me—that’s me—d’ye hear? that’s me”—here I screamed at the       top of my voice—“that’s me-e-e! I am Napoleon Bonaparte       Froissart! and if I havn’t married my great, great, grandmother,       I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!”        Madame Eugénie Lalande, _quasi_ Simpson—formerly Moissart—was, in       sober fact, my great, great, grandmother. In her youth she had       been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the majestic       height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes and the       Grecian nose of her girlhood. By the aid of these, of       pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false       tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she       contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties _en       peu passées_ of the French metropolis. In this respect, indeed,       she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the       celebrated Ninon De L’Enclos.        She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second time, a       widow without children, she bethought herself of my existence in       America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, paid a visit       to the United States, in company with a distant and exceedingly       lovely relative of her second husband’s—a Madame Stéphanie       Lalande.        At the opera, my great, great, grandmother’s attention was       arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her       eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to       herself. Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought       was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party       respecting me. The gentleman who attended her knew my person, and       told her who I was. The information thus obtained induced her to       renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened       me that I behaved in the absurd manner already detailed. She       returned my bow, however, under the impression that, by some odd       accident, I had discovered her identity. When, deceived by my       weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in respect to the       age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so       enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant       the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me,       with perfect truth, that she was “the celebrated widow, Madame       Lalande.”        In the street, next morning, my great, great, grandmother       encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the       conversation, very naturally turned upon myself. My deficiencies       of vision were then explained; for these were notorious, although       I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety, and my good old       relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that she had been       deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and that I had       been merely making a fool of myself in making open love, in a       theatre, to an old woman unknown. By way of punishing me for this       imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot. He purposely kept       out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. My street       inquiries about “the lovely widow, Madame Lalande,” were supposed       to refer to the younger lady, of course, and thus the       conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered shortly       after leaving Talbot’s hotel will be easily explained, as also       their allusion to Ninon De L’Enclos. I had no opportunity of       seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight; and, at her       musical _soirée_, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of       glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her       age. When “Madame Lalande” was called upon to sing, the younger       lady was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my       great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at       the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main       drawing-room. Had I decided upon escorting her thither, it had       been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I       was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary. The       songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my       impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame       Stéphanie Lalande. The eyeglass was presented by way of adding a       reproof to the hoax—a sting to the epigram of the deception. Its       presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon       affectation with which I was so especially edified. It is almost       superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by       the old lady, had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted       to my years. They suited me, in fact, to a T.        The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, was a       boon companion of Talbot’s, and no priest. He was an excellent       “whip,” however; and having doffed his cassock to put on a       great-coat, he drove the hack which conveyed the “happy couple”       out of town. Talbot took a seat at his side. The two scoundrels       were thus “in at the death,” and through a half-open window of       the back parlor of the inn, amused themselves in grinning at the       _dénouement_ of the drama. I believe I shall be forced to call       them both out.        Nevertheless, I am _not_ the husband of my great, great,       grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite       relief;—but I _am_ the husband of Madame Lalande—of Madame       Stéphanie Lalande—with whom my good old relative, besides making       me her sole heir when she dies—if she ever does—has been at the       trouble of concocting me a match. In conclusion: I am done       forever with _billets doux_, and am never to be met without       SPECTACLES.     KING PEST         A Tale Containing an Allegory.       The gods do bear and will allow in kings      The things which they abhor in rascal routes.                     —_Buckhurst’s Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex._        About twelve o’clock, one night in the month of October, and       during the chivalrous reign of the third Edward, two seamen       belonging to the crew of the _>Free and Easy_, a trading schooner       plying between Sluys and the Thames, and then at anchor in that       river, were much astonished to find themselves seated in the       tap-room of an ale-house in the parish of St. Andrews,       London—which ale-house bore for sign the portraiture of a “Jolly       Tar.”        The room, although ill-contrived, smoke-blackened, low-pitched,       and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of       such places at the period—was, nevertheless, in the opinion of       the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it,       sufficiently well adapted to its purpose.        Of these groups our two seamen formed, I think, the most       interesting, if not the most conspicuous.        The one who appeared to be the elder, and whom his companion       addressed by the characteristic appellation of “Legs,” was at the       same time much the taller of the two. He might have measured six       feet and a half, and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to       have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous.       Superfluities in height were, however, more than accounted for by       deficiencies in other respects. He was exceedingly thin; and       might, as his associates asserted, have answered, when drunk, for       a pennant at the mast-head, or, when sober, have served for a       jib-boom. But these jests, and others of a similar nature, had       evidently produced, at no time, any effect upon the cachinnatory       muscles of the tar. With high cheek-bones, a large hawk-nose,       retreating chin, fallen under-jaw, and huge protruding white       eyes, the expression of his countenance, although tinged with a       species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general,       was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts       at imitation or description.        The younger seaman was, in all outward appearance, the converse       of his companion. His stature could not have exceeded four feet.       A pair of stumpy bow-legs supported his squat, unwieldy figure,       while his unusually short and thick arms, with no ordinary fists       at their extremities, swung off dangling from his sides like the       fins of a sea-turtle. Small eyes, of no particular color,       twinkled far back in his head. His nose remained buried in the       mass of flesh which enveloped his round, full, and purple face;       and his thick upper-lip rested upon the still thicker one beneath       with an air of complacent self-satisfaction, much heightened by       the owner’s habit of licking them at intervals. He evidently       regarded his tall shipmate with a feeling half-wondrous,       half-quizzical; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red       setting sun stares up at the crags of Ben Nevis.        Various and eventful, however, had been the peregrinations of the       worthy couple in and about the different tap-houses of the       neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night. Funds even       the most ample, are not always everlasting: and it was with empty       pockets our friends had ventured upon the present hostelrie.        At the precise period, then, when this history properly       commences, Legs, and his fellow Hugh Tarpaulin, sat, each with       both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of       the floor, and with a hand upon either cheek. They were eyeing,       from behind a huge flagon of unpaid-for “humming-stuff,” the       portentous words, “No Chalk,” which to their indignation and       astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very       mineral whose presence they purported to deny. Not that the gift       of decyphering written characters—a gift among the commonalty of       that day considered little less cabalistical than the art of       inditing—could, in strict justice, have been laid to the charge       of either disciple of the sea; but there was, to say the truth, a       certain twist in the formation of the letters—an indescribable       lee-lurch about the whole—which foreboded, in the opinion of both       seamen, a long run of dirty weather; and determined them at once,       in the allegorical words of Legs himself, to “pump ship, clew up       all sail, and scud before the wind.”        Having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale, and       looped up the points of their short doublets, they finally made a       bolt for the street. Although Tarpaulin rolled twice into the       fire-place, mistaking it for the door, yet their escape was at       length happily effected—and half after twelve o’clock found our       heroes ripe for mischief, and running for life down a dark alley       in the direction of St. Andrew’s Stair, hotly pursued by the       landlady of the “Jolly Tar.”        At the epoch of this eventful tale, and periodically, for many       years before and after, all England, but more especially the       metropolis, resounded with the fearful cry of “Plague!” The city       was in a great measure depopulated—and in those horrible regions,       in the vicinity of the Thames, where amid the dark, narrow, and       filthy lanes and alleys, the Demon of Disease was supposed to       have had his nativity, Awe, Terror, and Superstition were alone       to be found stalking abroad.        By authority of the king such districts were placed under ban,       and all persons forbidden, under pain of death, to intrude upon       their dismal solitude. Yet neither the mandate of the monarch,       nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets,       nor the prospect of that loathsome death which, with almost       absolute certainty, overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could       deter from the adventure, prevented the unfurnished and       untenanted dwellings from being stripped, by the hand of nightly       rapine, of every article, such as iron, brass, or lead-work,       which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account.        Above all, it was usually found, upon the annual winter opening       of the barriers, that locks, bolts, and secret cellars, had       proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and       liquors which, in consideration of the risk and trouble of       removal, many of the numerous dealers having shops in the       neighbourhood had consented to trust, during the period of exile,       to so insufficient a security.        But there were very few of the terror-stricken people who       attributed these doings to the agency of human hands.       Pest-spirits, plague-goblins, and fever-demons, were the popular       imps of mischief; and tales so blood-chilling were hourly told,       that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was, at length,       enveloped in terror as in a shroud, and the plunderer himself was       often scared away by the horrors his own depreciations had       created; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district       to gloom, silence, pestilence, and death.        It was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned, and       which indicated the region beyond to be under the Pest-ban, that,       in scrambling down an alley, Legs and the worthy Hugh Tarpaulin       found their progress suddenly impeded. To return was out of the       question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were       close upon their heels. With thorough-bred seamen to clamber up       the roughly fashioned plank-work was a trifle; and, maddened with       the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor, they leaped       unhesitatingly down within the enclosure, and holding on their       drunken course with shouts and yellings, were soon bewildered in       its noisome and intricate recesses.        Had they not, indeed, been intoxicated beyond moral sense, their       reeling footsteps must have been palsied by the horrors of their       situation. The air was cold and misty. The paving-stones,       loosened from their beds, lay in wild disorder amid the tall,       rank grass, which sprang up around the feet and ankles. Fallen       houses choked up the streets. The most fetid and poisonous smells       everywhere prevailed;—and by the aid of that ghastly light which,       even at midnight, never fails to emanate from a vapory and       pestilential atmosphere, might be discerned lying in the by-paths       and alleys, or rotting in the windowless habitations, the carcass       of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague       in the very perpetration of his robbery.        But it lay not in the power of images, or sensations, or       impediments such as these, to stay the course of men who,       naturally brave, and at that time especially, brimful of courage       and of “humming-stuff,” would have reeled, as straight as their       condition might have permitted, undauntedly into the very jaws of       Death. Onward—still onward stalked the grim Legs, making the       desolate solemnity echo and re-echo with yells like the terrific       war-whoop of the Indian; and onward, still onward rolled the       dumpy Tarpaulin, hanging on to the doublet of his more active       companion, and far surpassing the latter’s most strenuous       exertions in the way of vocal music, by bull-roarings _in basso_,       from the profundity of his stentorian lungs.        They had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence.       Their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more       horrible—the paths more narrow and more intricate. Huge stones       and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them,       gave evidence, by their sullen and heavy descent, of the vast       height of the surrounding houses; and while actual exertion       became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of       rubbish, it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a       skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse.        Suddenly, as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall       and ghastly-looking building, a yell more than usually shrill       from the throat of the excited Legs, was replied to from within,       in a rapid succession of wild, laughter-like, and fiendish       shrieks. Nothing daunted at sounds which, of such a nature, at       such a time, and in such a place, might have curdled the very       blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire, the drunken couple       rushed headlong against the door, burst it open, and staggered       into the midst of things with a volley of curses.        The room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop       of an undertaker; but an open trap-door, in a corner of the floor       near the entrance, looked down upon a long range of wine-cellars,       whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed       to be well stored with their appropriate contents. In the middle       of the room stood a table—in the centre of which again arose a       huge tub of what appeared to be punch. Bottles of various wines       and cordials, together with jugs, pitchers, and flagons of every       shape and quality, were scattered profusely upon the board.       Around it, upon coffin-tressels, was seated a company of six.       This company I will endeavor to delineate one by one.        Fronting the entrance, and elevated a little above his       companions, sat a personage who appeared to be the president of       the table. His stature was gaunt and tall, and Legs was       confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself.       His face was as yellow as saffron—but no feature excepting one       alone, was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description.       This one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously       lofty, as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh       superadded upon the natural head. His mouth was puckered and       dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability, and his eyes,       as indeed the eyes of all at table, were glazed over with the       fumes of intoxication. This gentleman was clothed from head to       foot in a richly-embroidered black silk-velvet pall, wrapped       negligently around his form after the fashion of a Spanish cloak.       His head was stuck full of sable hearse-plumes, which he nodded       to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air; and, in his right hand,       he held a huge human thigh-bone, with which he appeared to have       been just knocking down some member of the company for a song.        Opposite him, and with her back to the door, was a lady of no       whit the less extraordinary character. Although quite as tall as       the person just described, she had no right to complain of his       unnatural emaciation. She was evidently in the last stage of a       dropsy; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon       of October beer which stood, with the head driven in, close by       her side, in a corner of the chamber. Her face was exceedingly       round, red, and full; and the same peculiarity, or rather want of       peculiarity, attached itself to her countenance, which I before       mentioned in the case of the president—that is to say, only one       feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a       separate characterization: indeed the acute Tarpaulin immediately       observed that the same remark might have applied to each       individual person of the party; every one of whom seemed to       possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy.       With the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth.       Commencing at the right ear, it swept with a terrific chasm to       the left—the short pendants which she wore in either auricle       continually bobbing into the aperture. She made, however, every       exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified, in a dress       consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close       under her chin, with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin.        At her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared       to patronise. This delicate little creature, in the trembling of       her wasted fingers, in the livid hue of her lips, and in the       slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion,       gave evident indications of a galloping consumption. An air of       extreme _haut ton_, however, pervaded her whole appearance; she       wore in a graceful and _dégagé_ manner, a large and beautiful       winding-sheet of the finest India lawn; her hair hung in ringlets       over her neck; a soft smile played about her mouth; but her nose,       extremely long, thin, sinuous, flexible and pimpled, hung down       far below her under lip, and in spite of the delicate manner in       which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her       tongue, gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression.        Over against her, and upon the left of the dropsical lady, was       seated a little puffy, wheezing, and gouty old man, whose cheeks       reposed upon the shoulders of their owner, like two huge bladders       of Oporto wine. With his arms folded, and with one bandaged leg       deposited upon the table, he seemed to think himself entitled to       some consideration. He evidently prided himself much upon every       inch of his personal appearance, but took more especial delight       in calling attention to his gaudy-colored surtout. This, to say       the truth, must have cost him no little money, and was made to       fit him exceedingly well—being fashioned from one of the       curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those       glorious escutcheons which, in England and elsewhere, are       customarily hung up, in some conspicuous place, upon the       dwellings of departed aristocracy.        Next to him, and at the right hand of the president, was a       gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers. His frame shook,       in a ridiculous manner, with a fit of what Tarpaulin called “the       horrors.” His jaws, which had been newly shaved, were tightly       tied up by a bandage of muslin; and his arms being fastened in a       similar way at the wrists, prevented him from helping himself too       freely to the liquors upon the table; a precaution rendered       necessary, in the opinion of Legs, by the peculiarly sottish and       wine-bibbing cast of his visage. A pair of prodigious ears,       nevertheless, which it was no doubt found impossible to confine,       towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment, and were       occasionally pricked up in a spasm, at the sound of the drawing       of a cork.        Fronting him, sixthly and lastly, was situated a singularly       stiff-looking personage, who, being afflicted with paralysis,       must, to speak seriously, have felt very ill at ease in his       unaccommodating habiliments. He was habited, somewhat uniquely,       in a new and handsome mahogany coffin. Its top or head-piece       pressed upon the skull of the wearer, and extended over it in the       fashion of a hood, giving to the entire face an air of       indescribable interest. Arm-holes had been cut in the sides, for       the sake not more of elegance than of convenience; but the dress,       nevertheless, prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as       his associates; and as he lay reclining against his tressel, at       an angle of forty-five degrees, a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled       up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement       at their own enormity.        Before each of the party lay a portion of a skull, which was used       as a drinking cup. Overhead was suspended a human skeleton, by       means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring       in the ceiling. The other limb, confined by no such fetter, stuck       off from the body at right angles, causing the whole loose and       rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every       occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment.       In the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited       charcoal, which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire       scene; while coffins, and other wares appertaining to the shop of       an undertaker, were piled high up around the room, and against       the windows, preventing any ray from escaping into the street.        At sight of this extraordinary assembly, and of their still more       extraordinary paraphernalia, our two seamen did not conduct       themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been       expected. Legs, leaning against the wall near which he happened       to be standing, dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual, and       spread open his eyes to their fullest extent: while Hugh       Tarpaulin, stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level       with the table, and spreading out a palm upon either knee, burst       into a long, loud, and obstreperous roar of very ill-timed and       immoderate laughter.        Without, however, taking offence at behaviour so excessively       rude, the tall president smiled very graciously upon the       intruders—nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of       sable plumes—and, arising, took each by an arm, and led him to a       seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime       for his accommodation. Legs to all this offered not the slightest       resistance, but sat down as he was directed; while the gallant       Hugh, removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head       of the table, to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in       the winding sheet, plumped down by her side in high glee, and       pouring out a skull of red wine, quaffed it to their better       acquaintance. But at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the       coffin seemed exceedingly nettled; and serious consequences might       have ensued, had not the president, rapping upon the table with       his truncheon, diverted the attention of all present to the       following speech:        “It becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion—”        “Avast there!” interrupted Legs, looking very serious, “avast       there a bit, I say, and tell us who the devil ye all are, and       what business ye have here, rigged off like the foul fiends, and       swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my       honest shipmate, Will Wimble, the undertaker!”        At this unpardonable piece of ill-breeding, all the original       company half started to their feet, and uttered the same rapid       succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the       attention of the seamen. The president, however, was the first to       recover his composure, and at length, turning to Legs with great       dignity, recommenced:        “Most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the       part of guests so illustrious, unbidden though they be. Know then       that in these dominions I am monarch, and here rule with       undivided empire under the title of ‘King Pest the First.’        “This apartment, which you no doubt profanely suppose to be the       shop of Will Wimble the undertaker—a man whom we know not, and       whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted       our royal ears—this apartment, I say, is the Dais-Chamber of our       Palace, devoted to the councils of our kingdom, and to other       sacred and lofty purposes.        “The noble lady who sits opposite is Queen Pest, our Serene       Consort. The other exalted personages whom you behold are all of       our family, and wear the insignia of the blood royal under the       respective titles of ‘His Grace the Arch Duke Pest-Iferous’—‘His       Grace the Duke Pest-Ilential’—‘His Grace the Duke Tem-Pest’—and       ‘Her Serene Highness the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.’        “As regards,” continued he, “your demand of the business upon       which we sit here in council, we might be pardoned for replying       that it concerns, and concerns alone, our own private and regal       interest, and is in no manner important to any other than       ourself. But in consideration of those rights to which as guests       and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled, we will       furthermore explain that we are here this night, prepared by deep       research and accurate investigation, to examine, analyze, and       thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit—the incomprehensible       qualities and nature—of those inestimable treasures of the       palate, the wines, ales, and liqueurs of this goodly metropolis:       by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true       welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all,       whose dominions are unlimited, and whose name is ‘Death’.”        “Whose name is Davy Jones!” ejaculated Tarpaulin, helping the       lady by his side to a skull of liqueur, and pouring out a second       for himself.        “Profane varlet!” said the president, now turning his attention       to the worthy Hugh, “profane and execrable wretch!—we have said,       that in consideration of those rights which, even in thy filthy       person, we feel no inclination to violate, we have condescended       to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries. We       nevertheless, for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils,       believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a       gallon of Black Strap—having imbibed which to the prosperity of       our kingdom—at a single draught—and upon your bended knees—ye       shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way, or       remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table, according       to your respective and individual pleasures.”        “It would be a matter of utter impossibility,” replied Legs, whom       the assumptions and dignity of King Pest the First had evidently       inspired some feelings of respect, and who arose and steadied       himself by the table as he spoke—“it would, please your majesty,       be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even       one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just       mentioned. To say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the       forenoon by way of ballast, and not to mention the various ales       and liqueurs shipped this evening at different sea-ports, I have,       at present, a full cargo of ‘humming-stuff’ taken in and duly       paid for at the sign of the ‘Jolly Tar.’ You will, therefore,       please your majesty, be so good as to take the will for the       deed—for by no manner of means either can I or will I swallow       another drop—least of all a drop of that villainous bilge-water       that answers to the name of ‘Black Strap.’”        “Belay that!” interrupted Tarpaulin, astonished not more at the       length of his companion’s speech than at the nature of his       refusal—“Belay that you lubber!—and I say, Legs, none of your       palaver! _My_ hull is still light, although I confess you       yourself seem to be a little top-heavy; and as for the matter of       your share of the cargo, why rather than raise a squall I would       find stowage-room for it myself, but—”        “This proceeding,” interposed the president, “is by no means in       accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence, which is in       its nature Median, and not to be altered or recalled. The       conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter, and       that without a moment’s hesitation—in failure of which fulfilment       we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together, and       duly drowned as rebels in yon hogshead of October beer!”        “A sentence!—a sentence!—a righteous and just sentence!—a       glorious decree!—a most worthy and upright, and holy       condemnation!” shouted the Pest family altogether. The king       elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles; the gouty little       old man puffed like a pair of bellows; the lady of the winding       sheet waved her nose to and fro; the gentleman in the cotton       drawers pricked up his ears; she of the shroud gasped like a       dying fish; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his       eyes.        “Ugh! ugh! ugh!” chuckled Tarpaulin without heeding the general       excitation, “ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—ugh! ugh! ugh!—I was       saying,” said he, “I was saying when Mr. King Pest poked in his       marlin-spike, that as for the matter of two or three gallons more       or less of Black Strap, it was a trifle to a tight sea-boat like       myself not overstowed—but when it comes to drinking the health of       the Devil (whom God assoilzie) and going down upon my marrow       bones to his ill-favored majesty there, whom I know, as well as I       know myself to be a sinner, to be nobody in the whole world, but       Tim Hurlygurly the stage-player!—why! it’s quite another guess       sort of a thing, and utterly and altogether past my       comprehension.”        He was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity. At the       name Tim Hurlygurly the whole assembly leaped from their name       seats.        “Treason!” shouted his Majesty King Pest the First.        “Treason!” said the little man with the gout.        “Treason!” screamed the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.        “Treason!” muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up.        “Treason!” growled he of the coffin.        “Treason! treason!” shrieked her majesty of the mouth; and,       seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate       Tarpaulin, who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull       of liqueur, she lifted him high into the air, and let him fall       without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale.       Bobbing up and down, for a few seconds, like an apple in a bowl       of toddy, he, at length, finally disappeared amid the whirlpool       of foam which, in the already effervescent liquor, his struggles       easily succeeded in creating.        Not tamely, however, did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture       of his companion. Jostling King Pest through the open trap, the       valiant Legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath, and       strode towards the centre of the room. Here tearing down the       skeleton which swung over the table, he laid it about him with so       much energy and good will, that, as the last glimpses of light       died away within the apartment, he succeeded in knocking out the       brains of the little gentleman with the gout. Rushing then with       all his force against the fatal hogshead full of October ale and       Hugh Tarpaulin, he rolled it over and over in an instant. Out       burst a deluge of liquor so fierce—so impetuous—so       overwhelming—that the room was flooded from wall to wall—the       loaded table was overturned—the tressels were thrown upon their       backs—the tub of punch into the fire-place—and the ladies into       hysterics. Piles of death-furniture floundered about. Jugs,       pitchers, and carboys mingled promiscuously in the _mêlée_, and       wicker flagons encountered desperately with bottles of junk. The       man with the horrors was drowned upon the spot—the little stiff       gentleman floated off in his coffin—and the victorious Legs,       seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud, rushed out with       her into the street, and made a bee-line for the _Free and Easy_,       followed under easy sail by the redoubtable Hugh Tarpaulin, who,       having sneezed three or four times, panted and puffed after him       with the Arch Duchess Ana-Pest.     THREE SUNDAYS IN A WEEK         “You hard-headed, dunder-headed, obstinate, rusty, crusty, musty,       fusty, old savage!” said I, in fancy, one afternoon, to my grand       uncle Rumgudgeon—shaking my fist at him in imagination.        Only in imagination. The fact is, some trivial discrepancy _did_       exist, just then, between what I said and what I had not the       courage to say—between what I did and what I had half a mind to       do.        The old porpoise, as I opened the drawing-room door, was sitting       with his feet upon the mantel-piece, and a bumper of port in his       paw, making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty.        Remplis ton verre vide!       Vide ton verre plein!        “My _dear_ uncle,” said I, closing the door gently, and       approaching him with the blandest of smiles, “you are always so       very kind and considerate, and have evinced your benevolence in       so many—so very many ways—that—that I feel I have only to suggest       this little point to you once more to make sure of your full       acquiescence.”        “Hem!” said he, “good boy! go on!”        “I am sure, my dearest uncle (you confounded old rascal!), that       you have no design really, seriously, to oppose my union with       Kate. This is merely a joke of yours, I know—ha! ha! ha!—how very       pleasant you are at times.”        “Ha! ha! ha!” said he, “curse you! yes!”        “To be sure—of course! I knew you were jesting. Now, uncle, all       that Kate and myself wish at present, is that you would oblige us       with your advice as—as regards the time—you know, uncle—in short,       when will it be most convenient for yourself, that the wedding       shall—shall—come off, you know?”        “Come off, you scoundrel!—what do you mean by that?—Better wait       till it goes on.”        “Ha! ha! ha!—he! he! he!—hi! hi! hi!—ho! ho! ho!—hu! hu! hu!—oh,       that’s good!—oh, that’s capital—_such_ a wit! But all we want       just _now_, you know, uncle, is that you would indicate the time       precisely.”        “Ah!—precisely?”        “Yes, uncle—that is, if it would be quite agreeable to yourself.”        “Wouldn’t it answer, Bobby, if I were to leave it at random—some       time within a year or so, for example?—_must_ I say precisely?”        “_If_ you please, uncle—precisely.”        “Well, then, Bobby, my boy—you’re a fine fellow, aren’t       you?—since you _will_ have the exact time I’ll—why I’ll oblige       you for once.”        “Dear uncle!”        “Hush, sir!” (drowning my voice)—“I’ll oblige you for once. You       shall have my consent—and the _plum_, we mus’n’t forget the       plum—let me see! when shall it be? To-day’s Sunday—isn’t it?       Well, then, you shall be married precisely—_precisely_, now       mind!—_when three Sundays come together in a week!_ Do you hear       me, sir! _What_ are you gaping at? I say, you shall have Kate and       her plum when three Sundays come together in a week—but not       _till_ then—you young scapegrace—not _till_ then, if I die for       it. You know me—_I’m a man of my word_—now be off!” Here he       swallowed his bumper of port, while I rushed from the room in       despair.        A very “fine old English gentleman,” was my grand-uncle       Rumgudgeon, but unlike him of the song, he had his weak points.       He was a little, pursy, pompous, passionate semicircular       somebody, with a red nose, a thick skull, a long purse, and a       strong sense of his own consequence. With the best heart in the       world, he contrived, through a predominant whim of contradiction,       to earn for himself, among those who only knew him superficially,       the character of a curmudgeon. Like many excellent people, he       seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization, which might       easily, at a casual glance, have been mistaken for malevolence.       To every request, a positive “No!” was his immediate answer; but       in the end—in the long, long end—there were exceedingly few       requests which he refused. Against all attacks upon his purse he       made the most sturdy defence; but the amount extorted from him,       at last, was generally in direct ratio with the length of the       siege and the stubbornness of the resistance. In charity no one       gave more liberally or with a worse grace.        For the fine arts, and especially for the belles-lettres, he       entertained a profound contempt. With this he had been inspired       by Casimir Perier, whose pert little query “A quoi un poete est       il bon?” he was in the habit of quoting, with a very droll       pronunciation, as the ne plus ultra of logical wit. Thus my own       inkling for the Muses had excited his entire displeasure. He       assured me one day, when I asked him for a new copy of Horace,       that the translation of “Poeta nascitur non fit” was “a nasty       poet for nothing fit”—a remark which I took in high dudgeon. His       repugnance to “the humanities” had, also, much increased of late,       by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural       science. Somebody had accosted him in the street, mistaking him       for no less a personage than Doctor Dubble L. Dee, the lecturer       upon quack physics. This set him off at a tangent; and just at       the epoch of this story—for story it is getting to be after       all—my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only       upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the       hobby he was riding. For the rest, he laughed with his arms and       legs, and his politics were stubborn and easily understood. He       thought, with Horsley, that “the people have nothing to do with       the laws but to obey them.”        I had lived with the old gentleman all my life. My parents, in       dying, had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy. I believe the       old villain loved me as his own child—nearly if not quite as well       as he loved Kate—but it was a dog’s existence that he led me,       after all. From my first year until my fifth, he obliged me with       very regular floggings. From five to fifteen, he threatened me,       hourly, with the House of Correction. From fifteen to twenty, not       a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a       shilling. I was a sad dog, it is true—but then it was a part of       my nature—a point of my faith. In Kate, however, I had a firm       friend, and I knew it. She was a good girl, and told me very       sweetly that I might have her (plum and all) whenever I could       badger my grand-uncle Rumgudgeon, into the necessary consent.       Poor girl!—she was barely fifteen, and without this consent, her       little amount in the funds was not come-at-able until five       immeasurable summers had “dragged their slow length along.” What,       then, to do? At fifteen, or even at twenty-one (for I had now       passed my fifth olympiad) five years in prospect are very much       the same as five hundred. In vain we besieged the old gentleman       with importunities. Here was a piece de resistance (as Messieurs       Ude and Careme would say) which suited his perverse fancy to a T.       It would have stiffed the indignation of Job himself, to see how       much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little       mice. In his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our       union. He had made up his mind to this all along. In fact, he       would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket (Kate’s       plum was her own) if he could have invented any thing like an       excuse for complying with our very natural wishes. But then we       had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves. Not to       oppose it under such circumstances, I sincerely believe, was not       in his power.        I have said already that he had his weak points; but in speaking       of these, I must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy:       which was one of his strong points—“assurement ce n’ etait pas sa       foible.” When I mention his weakness I have allusion to a bizarre       old-womanish superstition which beset him. He was great in       dreams, portents, et id genus omne of rigmarole. He was       excessively punctilious, too, upon small points of honor, and,       after his own fashion, was a man of his word, beyond doubt. This       was, in fact, one of his hobbies. The spirit of his vows he made       no scruple of setting at naught, but the letter was a bond       inviolable. Now it was this latter peculiarity in his       disposition, of which Kate’s ingenuity enabled us one fine day,       not long after our interview in the dining-room, to take a very       unexpected advantage, and, having thus, in the fashion of all       modern bards and orators, exhausted in prolegomena, all the time       at my command, and nearly all the room at my disposal, I will sum       up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story.        It happened then—so the Fates ordered it—that among the naval       acquaintances of my betrothed, were two gentlemen who had just       set foot upon the shores of England, after a year’s absence,       each, in foreign travel. In company with these gentlemen, my       cousin and I, preconcertedly paid uncle Rumgudgeon a visit on the       afternoon of Sunday, October the tenth,—just three weeks after       the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes.       For about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics,       but at last, we contrived, quite naturally, to give it the       following turn:        CAPT. PRATT. “Well I have been absent just one year.—Just one       year to-day, as I live—let me see! yes!—this is October the       tenth. You remember, Mr. Rumgudgeon, I called, this day year to       bid you good-bye. And by the way, it does seem something like a       coincidence, does it not—that our friend, Captain Smitherton,       here, has been absent exactly a year also—a year to-day!”        SMITHERTON. “Yes! just one year to a fraction. You will remember,       Mr. Rumgudgeon, that I called with Capt. Pratol on this very day,       last year, to pay my parting respects.”        UNCLE. “Yes, yes, yes—I remember it very well—very queer indeed!       Both of you gone just one year. A very strange coincidence,       indeed! Just what Doctor Dubble L. Dee would denominate an       extraordinary concurrence of events. Doctor Dub—”        KATE. (Interrupting.) “To be sure, papa, it is something strange;       but then Captain Pratt and Captain Smitherton didn’t go       altogether the same route, and that makes a difference, you       know.”        UNCLE. “I don’t know any such thing, you huzzy! How should I? I       think it only makes the matter more remarkable, Doctor Dubble L.       Dee—”        KATE. “Why, papa, Captain Pratt went round Cape Horn, and Captain       Smitherton doubled the Cape of Good Hope.”        UNCLE. “Precisely!—the one went east and the other went west, you       jade, and they both have gone quite round the world. By the by,       Doctor Dubble L. Dee—”        MYSELF. (Hurriedly.) “Captain Pratt, you must come and spend the       evening with us to-morrow—you and Smitherton—you can tell us all       about your voyage, and we’ll have a game of whist and—”        PRATT. “Wist, my dear fellow—you forget. To-morrow will be       Sunday. Some other evening—”        KATE. “Oh, no, fie!—Robert’s not quite so bad as that. To-day’s       Sunday.”        PRATT. “I beg both your pardons—but I can’t be so much mistaken.       I know to-morrow’s Sunday, because-”        SMITHERTON. (Much surprised.) “What are you all thinking about?       Wasn’t yesterday, Sunday, I should like to know?”        ALL. “Yesterday indeed! you are out!”        UNCLE. “To-day’s Sunday, I say—don’t I know?”        PRATT. “Oh no!—to-morrow’s Sunday.”        SMITHERTON. “You are all mad—every one of you. I am as positive       that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair.”        KATE. (Jumping up eagerly.) “I see it—I see it all. Papa, this is       a judgment upon you, about—about you know what. Let me alone, and       I’ll explain it all in a minute. It’s a very simple thing,       indeed. Captain Smitherton says that yesterday was Sunday: so it       was; he is right. Cousin Bobby, and uncle and I say that to-day       is Sunday: so it is; we are right. Captain Pratt maintains that       to-morrow will be Sunday: so it will; he is right, too. The fact       is, we are all right, and thus three Sundays have come together       in a week.”        SMITHERTON. (After a pause.) “By the by, Pratt, Kate has us       completely. What fools we two are! Mr. Rumgudgeon, the matter       stands thus: the earth, you know, is twenty-four thousand miles       in circumference. Now this globe of the earth turns upon its own       axis—revolves—spins round—these twenty-four thousand miles of       extent, going from west to east, in precisely twenty-four hours.       Do you understand, Mr. Rumgudgeon?—”        UNCLE. “To be sure—to be sure—Doctor Dub—”        SMITHERTON. (Drowning his voice.) “Well, sir; that is at the rate       of one thousand miles per hour. Now, suppose that I sail from       this position a thousand miles east. Of course I anticipate the       rising of the sun here at London by just one hour. I see the sun       rise one hour before you do. Proceeding, in the same direction,       yet another thousand miles, I anticipate the rising by two       hours—another thousand, and I anticipate it by three hours, and       so on, until I go entirely round the globe, and back to this       spot, when, having gone twenty-four thousand miles east, I       anticipate the rising of the London sun by no less than       twenty-four hours; that is to say, I am a day in advance of your       time. Understand, eh?”        UNCLE. “But Double L. Dee—”        SMITHERTON. (Speaking very loud.) “Captain Pratt, on the       contrary, when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this       position, was an hour, and when he had sailed twenty-four       thousand miles west, was twenty-four hours, or one day, behind       the time at London. Thus, with me, yesterday was Sunday—thus,       with you, to-day is Sunday—and thus, with Pratt, to-morrow will       be Sunday. And what is more, Mr. Rumgudgeon, it is positively       clear that we are all right; for there can be no philosophical       reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference       over that of the other.”        UNCLE. “My eyes!—well, Kate—well, Bobby!—this is a judgment upon       me, as you say. But I am a man of my word—mark that! you shall       have her, boy, (plum and all), when you please. Done up, by Jove!       Three Sundays all in a row! I’ll go, and take Dubble L. Dee’s       opinion upon that.”     End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 3, by Edgar Allan Poe  *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF EDGAR ALLAN POE, VOL. 3 ***  ***** This file should be named 2149-0.txt or 2149-0.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:         http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/4/2149/  Produced by David Widger  Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be renamed.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

my return to the united states a few months ago after the       extraordinary series of adventure in the south seas and       elsewhere of which an account is given in the following pages       accident threw me into the society of several gentlemen in       richmond va who felt deep interest in all matters relating to       the regions i had visited and who were constantly urging it upon       me as a duty to give my narrative to the public i had several       reasons however for declining to do so some of which were of a       nature altogether private and concern no person but myself       others not so much so one consideration which deterred me was       that having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time       in which i was absent i feared i should not be able to write       from mere memory a statement so minute and connected as to have       the appearanceof that truth it would really possess barring       only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us       are prone when detailing events which have had powerful influence       in exciting the imaginative faculties another reason was that       the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively       marvellous that unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be       except by the evidence of a single individual and he a       halfbreed indian i could only hope for belief among my family       and those of my friends who have had reason through life to put       faith in my veracitythe probability being that the public at       large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent       and ingenious fiction a distrust in my own abilities as a writer       was nevertheless one of the principal causes which prevented me       from complying with the suggestions of my advisers        among those gentlemen in virginia who expressed the greatest       interest in my statement more particularly in regard to that       portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean was mr poe       lately editor of the southern literary messenger a monthly       magazine published by mr thomas w white in the city of       richmond he strongly advised me among others to prepare at       once a full account of what i had seen and undergone and trust       to the shrewdness and commonsense of the publicinsisting with       great plausibility that however roughly as regards mere       authorship my book should be got up its very uncouthness if       there were any would give it all the better chance of being       received as truth        notwithstanding this representation i did not make up my mind to       do as he suggested he afterward proposed finding that i would       not stir in the matter that i should allow him to draw up in       his own words a narrative of the earlier portion of my       adventures from facts afforded by myself publishing it in the       southern messenger under the garb of fiction to this       perceiving no objection i consented stipulating only that my       real name should be retained two numbers of the pretended       fiction appeared consequently in the messenger for january       and february  and in order that it might certainly be       regarded as fiction the name of mr poe was affixed to the       articles in the table of contents of the magazine        the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at       length to undertake a regular compilation and publication of the       adventures in question for i found that in spite of the air of       fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of       my statement which appeared in the messenger without altering       or distorting a single fact the public were still not at all       disposed to receive it as fable and several letters were sent to       mr ps address distinctly expressing a conviction to the       contrary i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would       prove of such a nature as to carry with them sufficient evidence       of their own authenticity and that i had consequently little to       fear on the score of popular incredulity        this exposébeing made it will be seen at once how much of what       follows i claim to be my own writing and it will also be       understood that no fact is misrepresented in the first few pages       which were written by mr poe even to those readers who have not       seen the messenger it will be unnecessary to point out where       his portion ends and my own commences the difference in point of       style will be readily perceived  a g pym     chapter          my name is arthur gordon pym my father was a respectable trader       in seastores at nantucket where i was born my maternal       grandfather was an attorney in good practice he was fortunate in       every thing and had speculated very successfully in stocks of       the edgarton new bank as it was formerly called by these and       other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money he       was more attached to myself i believe than to any other person       in the world and i expected to inherit the most of his property       at his death he sent me at six years of age to the school of       old mr ricketts a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric       mannershe is well known to almost every person who has visited       new bedford i stayed at his school until i was sixteen when i       left him for mr e ronalds academy on the hill here i became       intimate with the son of mr barnard a seacaptain who       generally sailed in the employ of lloyd and vredenburghmr       barnard is also very well known in new bedford and has many       relations i am certain in edgarton his son was named augustus       and he was nearly two years older than myself he had been on a       whaling voyage with his father in the john donaldson and was       always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific       ocean i used frequently to go home with him and remain all day       and sometimes all night we occupied the same bed and he would       be sure to keep me awake until almost light telling me stories       of the natives of the island of tinian and other places he had       visited in his travels at last i could not help being interested       in what he said and by degrees i felt the greatest desire to go       to sea i owned a sailboat called the ariel and worth about       seventyfive dollars she had a halfdeck or cuddy and was       rigged sloopfashioni forget her tonnage but she would hold ten       persons without much crowding in this boat we were in the habit       of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world and when i       now think of them it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am       alive today        i will relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a       longer and more momentous narrative one night there was a party       at mr barnards and both augustus and myself were not a little       intoxicated toward the close of it as usual in such cases i       took part of his bed in preference to going home he went to       sleep as i thought very quietly it being near one when the       party broke up and without saying a word on his favorite topic       it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in       bed and i was just about falling into a doze when he suddenly       started up and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go       to sleep for any arthur pym in christendom when there was so       glorious a breeze from the southwest i never was so astonished       in my life not knowing what he intended and thinking that the       wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside       himself he proceeded to talk very coolly however saying he       knew that i supposed him intoxicated but that he was never more       sober in his life he was only tired he added of lying in bed       on such a fine night like a dog and was determined to get up and       dress and go out on a frolic with the boat i can hardly tell       what possessed me but the words were no sooner out of his mouth       than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure and       thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most       reasonable things in the world it was blowing almost a gale and       the weather was very coldit being late in october i sprang out       of bed nevertheless in a kind of ecstasy and told him i was       quite as brave as himself and quite as tired as he was of lying       in bed like a dog and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as       any augustus barnard in nantucket        we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to       the boat she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the       lumberyard of pankey  co and almost thumping her side out       against the rough logs augustus got into her and bailed her for       she was nearly half full of water this being done we hoisted       jib and mainsail kept full and started boldly out to sea        the wind as i before said blew freshly from the southwest the       night was very clear and cold augustus had taken the helm and i       stationed myself by the mast on the deck of the cuddy we flew       along at a great rateneither of us having said a word since       casting loose from the wharf i now asked my companion what       course he intended to steer and what time he thought it probable       we should get back he whistled for a few minutes and then said       crustily i am going to seayou may go home if you think       proper turning my eyes upon him i perceived at once that in       spite of his assumed nonchalance he was greatly agitated i       could see him distinctly by the light of the moonhis face was       paler than any marble and his hand shook so excessively that he       could scarcely retain hold of the tiller i found that something       had gone wrong and became seriously alarmed at this period i       knew little about the management of a boat and was now depending       entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend the wind too had       suddenly increased as we were fast getting out of the lee of the       landstill i was ashamed to betray any trepidation and for       almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence i could stand       it no longer however and spoke to augustus about the propriety       of turning back as before it was nearly a minute before he made       answer or took any notice of my suggestion byandby said he       at lengthtime enoughhome byandby i had expected a similar       reply but there was something in the tone of these words which       filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread i again looked       at the speaker attentively his lips were perfectly livid and       his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely       able to stand for gods sake augustus i screamed now       heartily frightened what ails youwhat is the matterwhat       are you going to do matter he stammered in the greatest       apparent surprise letting go the tiller at the same moment and       falling forward into the bottom of the boatmatterwhy nothing       is themattergoing homedddont you see the whole truth now       flashed upon me i flew to him and raised him up he was       drunkbeastly drunkhe could no longer either stand speak or       see his eyes were perfectly glazed and as i let him go in the       extremity of my despair he rolled like a mere log into the       bilgewater from which i had lifted him it was evident that       during the evening he had drunk far more than i suspected and       that his conduct in bed had been the result of a       highlyconcentrated state of intoxicationa state which like       madness frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward       demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses the       coolness of the night air however had had its usual effectthe       mental energy began to yield before its influenceand the       confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous       situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe he was now       thoroughly insensible and there was no probability that he would       be otherwise for many hours        it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror the       fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated leaving me doubly       timid and irresolute i knew that i was altogether incapable of       managing the boat and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide       were hurrying us to destruction a storm was evidently gathering       behind us we had neither compass nor provisions and it was       clear that if we held our present course we should be out of       sight of land before daybreak these thoughts with a crowd of       others equally fearful flashed through my mind with a       bewildering rapidity and for some moments paralyzed me beyond       the possibility of making any exertion the boat was going       through the water at a terrible ratefull before the windno reef       in either jib or mainsailrunning her bows completely under the       foam it was a thousand wonders she did not broach toaugustus       having let go the tiller as i said before and i being too much       agitated to think of taking it myself by good luck however she       kept steady and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of       mind still the wind was increasing fearfully and whenever we       rose from a plunge forward the sea behind fell combing over our       counter and deluged us with water i was so utterly benumbed       too in every limb as to be nearly unconscious of sensation at       length i summoned up the resolution of despair and rushing to       the mainsail let it go by the run as might have been expected       it flew over the bows and getting drenched with water carried       away the mast short off by the board this latter accident alone       saved me from instant destruction under the jib only i now       boomed along before the wind shipping heavy seas occasionally       over the counter but relieved from the terror of immediate       death i took the helm and breathed with greater freedom as i       found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape       augustus still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat and as       there was imminent danger of his drowning the water being nearly       a foot deep just where he fell i contrived to raise him       partially up and keep him in a sitting position by passing a       rope round his waist and lashing it to a ringbolt in the deck of       the cuddy having thus arranged every thing as well as i could in       my chilled and agitated condition i recommended myself to god       and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the       fortitude in my power        hardly had i come to this resolution when suddenly a loud and       long scream or yell as if from the throats of a thousand demons       seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere around and above the boat       never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i       experienced at that moment my hair stood erect on my headi felt       the blood congealing in my veinsmy heart ceased utterly to beat       and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my       alarm i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my       fallen companion        i found myself upon reviving in the cabin of a large       whalingship the penguin bound to nantucket several persons       were standing over me and augustus paler than death was busily       occupied in chafing my hands upon seeing me open my eyes his       exclamations of gratitude and joy excited alternate laughter and       tears from the roughlooking personages who were present the       mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained we had       been run down by the whalingship which was closehauled       beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set       and consequently running almost at right angles to our own       course several men were on the lookout forward but did not       perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming       in contacttheir shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so       terribly alarmed me the huge ship i was told rode immediately       over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have       passed over a feather and without the least perceptible       impediment to her progress not a scream arose from the deck of       the victimthere was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling       with the roar of wind and water as the frail bark which was       swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her       destroyerbut this was all thinking our boat which it will be       remembered was dismasted some mere shell cut adrift as useless       the captain captain e t v block of new london was for       proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about       the matter luckily there were two of the lookout who swore       positively to having seen some person at our helm and       represented the possibility of yet saving him a discussion       ensued when block grew angry and after a while said that it       was no business of his to be eternally watching for eggshells       that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense and if       there was a man run down it was nobodys fault but his own he       might drown and be dammed or some language to that effect       henderson the first mate now took the matter up being justly       indignant as well as the whole ships crew at a speech evincing       so base a degree of heartless atrocity he spoke plainly seeing       himself upheld by the men told the captain he considered him a       fit subject for the gallows and that he would disobey his orders       if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore he       strode aft jostling block who turned pale and made no answer       on one side and seizing the helm gave the word in a firm       voice hardalee the men flew to their posts and the ship went       cleverly about all this had occupied nearly five minutes and it       was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that       any individual could be savedallowing any to have been on board       the boat yet as the reader has seen both augustus and myself       were rescued and our deliverance seemed to have been brought       about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune       which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special       interference of providence        while the ship was yet in stays the mate lowered the jollyboat       and jumped into her with the very two men i believe who spoke       up as having seen me at the helm they had just left the lee of       the vessel the moon still shining brightly when she made a long       and heavy roll to windward and henderson at the same moment       starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water he       would say nothing elserepeating his cry impatiently back water       back water the men put back as speedily as possible but by this       time the ship had gone round and gotten fully under headway       although all hands on board were making great exertions to take       in sail in despite of the danger of the attempt the mate clung       to the mainchains as soon as they came within his reach another       huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of       water nearly as far as her keel when the cause of his anxiety       was rendered obvious enough the body of a man was seen to be       affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining       bottom the penguin was coppered and copperfastened and       beating violently against it with every movement of the hull       after several ineffectual efforts made during the lurches of the       ship and at the imminent risk of swamping the boat i was finally       disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on boardfor the       body proved to be my own it appeared that one of the       timberbolts having started and broken a passage through the       copper it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship       and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom the       head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green       baize jacket i had on and through the back part of my neck       forcing itself out between two sinews and just below the right       ear i was immediately put to bedalthough life seemed to be       totally extinct there was no surgeon on board the captain       however treated me with every attentionto make amends i       presume in the eyes of his crew for his atrocious behaviour in       the previous portion of the adventure        in the meantime henderson had again put off from the ship       although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane he had not       been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our       boat and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that       he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring       of the tempest this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in       their search for more than half an hour although repeated       signals to return were made them by captain block and although       every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them       with the most imminent and deadly peril indeed it is nearly       impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could       have escaped destruction for a single instant she was built       however for the whaling service and was fitted as i have since       had reason to believe with airboxes in the manner of some       lifeboats used on the coast of wales        after searching in vain for about the period of time just       mentioned it was determined to get back to the ship they had       scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark       object that floated rapidly by they pursued and soon overtook       it it proved to be the entire deck of the ariels cuddy       augustus was struggling near it apparently in the last agonies       upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a       rope to the floating timber this rope it will be remembered i       had myself tied around his waist and made fast to a ringbolt       for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position and my so       doing it appeared had been ultimately the means of preserving       his life the ariel was slightly put together and in going down       her frame naturally went to pieces the deck of the cuddy as       might have been expected was lifted by the force of the water       rushing in entirely from the main timbers and floated with       other fragments no doubt to the surfaceaugustus was buoyed up       with it and thus escaped a terrible death        it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin       before he could give any account of himself or be made to       comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our       boat at length he became thoroughly aroused and spoke much of       his sensations while in the water upon his first attaining any       degree of consciousness he found himself beneath the surface       whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity and with a       rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck in an       instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward when his       head striking violently against a hard substance he again       relapsed into insensibility upon once more reviving he was in       fuller possession of his reasonthis was still however in the       greatest degree clouded and confused he now knew that some       accident had occurred and that he was in the water although his       mouth was above the surface and he could breathe with some       freedom possibly at this period the deck was drifting rapidly       before the wind and drawing him after it as he floated upon his       back of course as long as he could have retained this position       it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned       presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck and this       post he endeavored to maintain screaming at intervals for help       just before he was discovered by mr henderson he had been       obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion and falling into       the sea had given himself up for lost during the whole period       of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the       ariel nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his       disaster a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire       possession of his faculties when he was finally picked up every       power of his mind had failed him and as before said it was       nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he       became fully aware of his condition in regard to myselfi was       resuscitated from a state bordering very nearly upon death and       after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours       and a half by vigorous friction with flannels bathed in hot       oila proceeding suggested by augustus the wound in my neck       although of an ugly appearance proved of little real       consequence and i soon recovered from its effects        the penguin got into port about nine oclock in the morning       after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off       nantucket both augustus and myself managed to appear at mr       barnards in time for breakfastwhich luckily was somewhat       late owing to the party over night i suppose all at the table       were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded       appearanceof course it would not have borne a very rigid       scrutiny schoolboys however can accomplish wonders in the way       of deception and i verily believe not one of our friends in       nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story       told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at       sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils had reference       either to the ariel my companion or myself we two have since       very frequently talked the matter overbut never without a       shudder in one of our conversations augustus frankly confessed       to me that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so       excruciating a sense of dismay as when on board our little boat       he first discovered the extent of his intoxication and felt       himself sinking beneath its influence     chapter          in no affairs of mere prejudice pro or con do we deduce       inferences with entire certainty even from the most simple data       it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just       related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for       the sea on the contrary i never experienced a more ardent       longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a       navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance       this short period proved amply long enough to erase from my       memory the shadows and bring out in vivid light all the       pleasurably exciting points of color all the picturesqueness of       the late perilous accident my conversations with augustus grew       daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest he had a       manner of relating his stories of the ocean more than one half       of which i now suspect to have been sheer fabrications well       adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament       and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination it is strange       too that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the       life of a seaman when he depicted his more terrible moments of       suffering and despair for the bright side of the painting i had       a limited sympathy my visions were of shipwreck and famine of       death or captivity among barbarian hordes of a lifetime dragged       out in sorrow and tears upon some gray and desolate rock in an       ocean unapproachable and unknown such visions or desiresfor       they amounted to desiresare common i have since been assured       to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among menat the       time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses       of a destiny which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil       augustus thoroughly entered into my state of mind it is       probable indeed that our intimate communion had resulted in a       partial interchange of character        about eighteen months after the period of the ariels disaster       the firm of lloyd and vredenburgh a house connected in some       manner with the messieurs enderby i believe of liverpool were       engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a       whaling voyage she was an old hulk and scarcely seaworthy when       all was done to her that could be done i hardly know why she was       chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same       ownersbut so it was mr barnard was appointed to command her       and augustus was going with him while the brig was getting       ready he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the       opportunity now offered for indulging my desire of travel he       found me by no means an unwilling listeneryet the matter could       not be so easily arranged my father made no direct opposition       but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the       design and more than all my grandfather from whom i expected       much vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever broach       the subject to him again these difficulties however so far       from abating my desire only added fuel to the flame i       determined to go at all hazards and having made known my       intentions to augustus we set about arranging a plan by which it       might be accomplished in the meantime i forbore speaking to any       of my relations in regard to the voyage and as i busied myself       ostensibly with my usual studies it was supposed that i had       abandoned the design i have since frequently examined my conduct       on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of       surprise the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance       of my projectan hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my       life for so long a period of timecould only have been rendered       tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with       which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my longcherished       visions of travel        in pursuance of my scheme of deception i was necessarily obliged       to leave much to the management of augustus who was employed for       the greater part of every day on board the grampus attending to       some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold at       night however we were sure to have a conference and talk over       our hopes after nearly a month passed in this manner without       our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed he told       me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary i       had a relation living in new bedford a mr ross at whose house       i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at       a time the brig was to sail about the middle of june june        and it was agreed that a day or two before her putting to       sea my father was to receive a note as usual from mr ross       asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with robert and       emmet his sons augustus charged himself with the inditing of       this note and getting it delivered having set out as supposed       for new bedford i was then to report myself to my companion who       would contrive a hidingplace for me in the grampus this       hidingplace he assured me would be rendered sufficiently       comfortable for a residence of many days during which i was not       to make my appearance when the brig had proceeded so far on her       course as to make any turning back a matter out of question i       should then he said be formally installed in all the comforts       of the cabin and as to his father he would only laugh heartily       at the joke vessels enough would be met with by which a letter       might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents        the middle of june at length arrived and every thing had been       matured the note was written and delivered and on a monday       morning i left the house for the new bedford packet as supposed       i went however straight to augustus who was waiting for me at       the corner of a street it had been our original plan that i       should keep out of the way until dark and then slip on board the       brig but as there was now a thick fog in our favor it was       agreed to lose no time in secreting me augustus led the way to       the wharf and i followed at a little distance enveloped in a       thick seamans cloak which he had brought with him so that my       person might not be easily recognized just as we turned the       second corner after passing mr edmunds well who should       appear standing right in front of me and looking me full in the       face but old mr peterson my grandfather why bless my soul       gordon said he after a long pause why whywhose dirty       cloak is that you have on sir i replied assuming as well       as i could in the exigency of the moment an air of offended       surprise and talking in the gruffest of all imaginable       tonessir you are a summat mistakenmy name in the first       place beent nothing at all like goddin and id want you for to       know better you blackguard than to call my new obercoat a darty       one for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with       laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received       this handsome rebuke he started back two or three steps turned       first pale and then excessively red threw up his spectacles       then putting them down ran full tilt at me with his umbrella       uplifted he stopped short however in his career as if struck       with a sudden recollection and presently turning round hobbled       off down the street shaking all the while with rage and       muttering between his teeth wont donew glassesthought it was       gordondd goodfornothing salt water long tom        after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution and       arrived at our point of destination in safety there were only       one or two of the hands on board and these were busy forward       doing something to the forecastle combings captain barnard we       knew very well was engaged at lloyd and vredenburghs and would       remain there until late in the evening so we had little to       apprehend on his account augustus went first up the vessels       side and in a short while i followed him without being noticed       by the men at work we proceeded at once into the cabin and       found no person there it was fitted up in the most comfortable       stylea thing somewhat unusual in a whalingvessel there were       four very excellent staterooms with wide and convenient berths       there was also a large stove i took notice and a remarkably       thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin       and staterooms the ceiling was full seven feet high and in       short every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature       than i had anticipated augustus however would allow me but       little time for observation insisting upon the necessity of my       concealing myself as soon as possible he led the way into his       own stateroom which was on the starboard side of the brig and       next to the bulkheads upon entering he closed the door and       bolted it i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than       the one in which i now found myself it was about ten feet long       and had only one berth which as i said before was wide and       convenient in that portion of the closet nearest the bulkheads       there was a space of four feet square containing a table a       chair and a set of hanging shelves full of books chiefly books       of voyages and travels there were many other little comforts in       the room among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or       refrigerator in which augustus pointed out to me a host of       delicacies both in the eating and drinking department        he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the       carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned letting me know       that a portion of the flooring about sixteen inches square had       been neatly cut out and again adjusted as he pressed this       portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of       his finger beneath in this manner he raised the mouth of the       trap to which the carpet was still fastened by tacks and i       found that it led into the after hold he next lit a small taper       by means of a phosphorous match and placing the light in a dark       lantern descended with it through the opening bidding me       follow i did so and he then pulled the cover upon the hole by       means of a nail driven into the under sidethe carpet of course       resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom and       all traces of the aperture being concealed        the taper gave out so feeble a ray that it was with the greatest       difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of       lumber among which i now found myself by degrees however my       eyes became accustomed to the gloom and i proceeded with less       trouble holding on to the skirts of my friends coat he brought       me at length after creeping and winding through innumerable       narrow passages to an ironbound box such as is used sometimes       for packing fine earthenware it was nearly four feet high and       full six long but very narrow two large empty oilcasks lay on       the top of it and above these again a vast quantity of straw       matting piled up as high as the floor of the cabin in every       other direction around was wedged as closely as possible even up       to the ceiling a complete chaos of almost every species of       shipfurniture together with a heterogeneous medley of crates       hampers barrels and bales so that it seemed a matter no less       than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the       box i afterward found that augustus had purposely arranged the       stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough       concealment having had only one assistant in the labour a man       not going out in the brig        my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could       be removed at pleasure he slipped it aside and displayed the       interior at which i was excessively amused a mattress from one       of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom and it       contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be       crowded into so small a space allowing me at the same time       sufficient room for my accommodation either in a sitting       position or lying at full length among other things there were       some books pen ink and paper three blankets a large jug full       of water a keg of seabiscuit three or four immense bologna       sausages an enormous ham a cold leg of roast mutton and half a       dozen bottles of cordials and liqueurs i proceeded immediately       to take possession of my little apartment and this with feelings       of higher satisfaction i am sure than any monarch ever       experienced upon entering a new palace augustus now pointed out       to me the method of fastening the open end of the box and then       holding the taper close to the deck showed me a piece of dark       whipcord lying along it this he said extended from my       hidingplace throughout all the necessary windings among the       lumber to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold       immediately beneath the trapdoor leading into his stateroom by       means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way       out without his guidance provided any unlookedfor accident       should render such a step necessary he now took his departure       leaving with me the lantern together with a copious supply of       tapers and phosphorous and promising to pay me a visit as often       as he could contrive to do so without observation this was on       the seventeenth of june        i remained three days and nights as nearly as i could guess in       my hidingplace without getting out of it at all except twice       for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between       two crates just opposite the opening during the whole period i       saw nothing of augustus but this occasioned me little       uneasiness as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every       hour and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of       coming down to me at length i heard the trap open and shut and       presently he called in a low voice asking if all was well and       if there was any thing i wanted nothing i replied i am as       comfortable as can be when will the brig sail she will be       under weigh in less than half an hour he answered i came to       let you know and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence i       shall not have a chance of coming down again for some       timeperhaps for three or four days more all is going on right       aboveboard after i go up and close the trap do you creep along       by the whipcord to where the nail is driven in you will find my       watch thereit may be useful to you as you have no daylight to       keep time by i suppose you cant tell how long you have been       buriedonly three daysthis is the twentieth i would bring the       watch to your box but am afraid of being missed with this he       went up        in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in       motion and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly       commenced a voyage satisfied with this idea i determined to       make my mind as easy as possible and await the course of events       until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more       roomy although hardly more comfortable accommodations of the       cabin my first care was to get the watch leaving the taper       burning i groped along in the dark following the cord through       windings innumerable in some of which i discovered that after       toiling a long distance i was brought back within a foot or two       of a former position at length i reached the nail and securing       the object of my journey returned with it in safety i now       looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided       and selected the expedition of lewis and clarke to the mouth of       the columbia with this i amused myself for some time when       growing sleepy i extinguished the light with great care and       soon fell into a sound slumber        upon awakening i felt strangely confused in mind and some time       elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various       circumstances of my situation by degrees however i remembered       all striking a light i looked at the watch but it was run       down and there were consequently no means of determining how       long i slept my limbs were greatly cramped and i was forced to       relieve them by standing between the crates presently feeling an       almost ravenous appetite i bethought myself of the cold mutton       some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep and found       excellent what was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a       state of absolute putrefaction this circumstance occasioned me       great disquietude for connecting it with the disorder of mind i       experienced upon awakening i began to suppose that i must have       slept for an inordinately long period of time the close       atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this       and might in the end be productive of the most serious results       my head ached excessively i fancied that i drew every breath       with difficulty and in short i was oppressed with a multitude       of gloomy feelings still i could not venture to make any       disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise and having wound       up the watch contented myself as well as possible        throughout the whole of the next tedious twentyfour hours no       person came to my relief and i could not help accusing augustus       of the grossest inattention what alarmed me chiefly was that       the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint and i was       suffering much from thirst having eaten freely of the bologna       sausages after the loss of my mutton i became very uneasy and       could no longer take any interest in my books i was overpowered       too with a desire to sleep yet trembled at the thought of       indulging it lest there might exist some pernicious influence       like that of burning charcoal in the confined air of the hold       in the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in       the main ocean and a dull humming sound which reached my ears       as if from an immense distance convinced me no ordinary gale was       blowing i could not imagine a reason for the absence of       augustus we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to       allow of my going up some accident might have happened to       himbut i could think of none which would account for his       suffering me to remain so long a prisoner except indeed his       having suddenly died or fallen overboard and upon this idea i       could not dwell with any degree of patience it was possible that       we had been baffled by head winds and were still in the near       vicinity of nantucket this notion however i was forced to       abandon for such being the case the brig must have frequently       gone about and i was entirely satisfied from her continual       inclination to the larboard that she had been sailing all along       with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter besides granting       that we were still in the neighborhood of the island why should       not augustus have visited me and informed me of the circumstance       pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and       cheerless condition i resolved to wait yet another twentyfour       hours when if no relief were obtained i would make my way to       the trap and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend       or get at least a little fresh air through the opening and a       further supply of water from the stateroom while occupied with       this thought however i fell in spite of every exertion to the       contrary into a state of profound sleep or rather stupor my       dreams were of the most terrific description every species of       calamity and horror befell me among other miseries i was       smothered to death between huge pillows by demons of the most       ghastly and ferocious aspect immense serpents held me in their       embrace and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully       shining eyes then deserts limitless and of the most forlorn       and aweinspiring character spread themselves out before me       immensely tall trunks of trees gray and leafless rose up in       endless succession as far as the eye could reach their roots       were concealed in widespreading morasses whose dreary water lay       intensely black still and altogether terrible beneath and the       strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality and waving to       and fro their skeleton arms were crying to the silent waters for       mercy in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony       and despair the scene changed and i stood naked and alone       amidst the burning sandplains of sahara at my feet lay crouched       a fierce lion of the tropics suddenly his wild eyes opened and       fell upon me with a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet and       laid bare his horrible teeth in another instant there burst from       his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament and i       fell impetuously to the earth stifling in a paroxysm of terror       i at last found myself partially awake my dream then was not       all a dream now at least i was in possession of my senses the       paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my       bosomhis hot breath was in my earand his white and ghastly       fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom        had a thousand lives hung upon the movement of a limb or the       utterance of a syllable i could have neither stirred nor spoken       the beast whatever it was retained his position without       attempting any immediate violence while i lay in an utterly       helpless and i fancied a dying condition beneath him i felt       that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving mein a word       that i was perishing and perishing of sheer fright my brain       swami grew deadly sickmy vision failedeven the glaring       eyeballs above me grew dim making a last strong effort i at       length breathed a faint ejaculation to god and resigned myself       to die the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent       fury of the animal he precipitated himself at full length upon       my body but what was my astonishment when with a long and low       whine he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest       eagerness and with the most extravagant demonstration of       affection and joy i was bewildered utterly lost in       amazementbut i could not forget the peculiar whine of my       newfoundland dog tiger and the odd manner of his caresses i well       knew it was he i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my       templesa giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and       reanimation i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had       been lying and throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful       follower and friend relieved the long oppression of my bosom in       a flood of the most passionate tears        as upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the       greatest indistinctness and confusion after leaving the mattress       for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any       ideas but by very slow degrees my thinking faculties returned       and i again called to memory the several incidents of my       condition for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account       and after busying myself with a thousand different conjectures       respecting him was forced to content myself with rejoicing that       he was with me to share my dreary solitude and render me comfort       by his caresses most people love their dogsbut for tiger i had       an affection far more ardent than common and never certainly       did any creature more truly deserve it for seven years he had       been my inseparable companion and in a multitude of instances       had given evidence of all the noble qualities for which we value       the animal i had rescued him when a puppy from the clutches of       a malignant little villain in nantucket who was leading him with       a rope around his neck to the water and the grown dog repaid       the obligation about three years afterward by saving me from       the bludgeon of a street robber        getting now hold of the watch i found upon applying it to my       ear that it had again run down but at this i was not at all       surprised being convinced from the peculiar state of my       feelings that i had slept as before for a very long period of       time how long it was of course impossible to say i was burning       up with fever and my thirst was almost intolerable i felt about       the box for my little remaining supply of water for i had no       light the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern and       the phosphorusbox not coming readily to hand upon finding the       jug however i discovered it to be emptytiger no doubt having       been tempted to drink it as well as to devour the remnant of       mutton the bone of which lay well picked by the opening of the       box the spoiled meat i could well spare but my heart sank as i       thought of the water i was feeble in the extremeso much so that       i shook all over as with an ague at the slightest movement or       exertion to add to my troubles the brig was pitching and       rolling with great violence and the oilcasks which lay upon my       box were in momentary danger of falling down so as to block up       the only way of ingress or egress i felt also terrible       sufferings from seasickness these considerations determined me       to make my way at all hazards to the trap and obtain immediate       relief before i should be incapacitated from doing so       altogether having come to this resolve i again felt about for       the phosphorusbox and tapers the former i found after some       little trouble but not discovering the tapers as soon as i had       expected for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had       placed them i gave up the search for the present and bidding       tiger lie quiet began at once my journey toward the trap        in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever       apparent it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along       at all and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath       me when falling prostrate on my face i would remain for some       minutes in a state bordering on insensibility still i struggled       forward by slow degrees dreading every moment that i should       swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber in       which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result at       length upon making a push forward with all the energy i could       command i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner       of an ironbound crate the accident only stunned me for a few       moments but i found to my inexpressible grief that the quick       and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely       across my path so as effectually to block up the passage with       my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its       position it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes       and shipfurniture it became necessary therefore enfeebled as       i was either to leave the guidance of the whipcord and seek out       a new passage or to climb over the obstacle and resume the path       on the other side the former alternative presented too many       difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder in       my present weak state of both mind and body i should infallibly       lose my way if i attempted it and perish miserably amid the       dismal and disgusting labyrinths of the hold i proceeded       therefore without hesitation to summon up all my remaining       strength and fortitude and endeavour as i best might to       clamber over the crate        upon standing erect with this end in view i found the       undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to       imagine on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall       of various heavy lumber which the least blunder on my part might       be the means of bringing down upon my head or if this accident       did not occur the path might be effectually blocked up against       my return by the descending mass as it was in front by the       obstacle there the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box       upon which no foothold could be obtained in vain i attempted by       every means in my power to reach the top with the hope of being       thus enabled to draw myself up had i succeeded in reaching it       it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly       inadequate to the task of getting over and it was better in       every respect that i failed at length in a desperate effort to       force the crate from its ground i felt a strong vibration in the       side next me i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks       and found that a very large one was loose with my pocketknife       which luckily i had with me i succeeded after great labour       in prying it entirely off and getting it through the aperture       discovered to my exceeding joy that there were no boards on the       opposite sidein other words that the top was wanting it being       the bottom through which i had forced my way i now met with no       important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally       reached the nail with a beating heart i stood erect and with a       gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap it did not       rise as soon as i had expected and i pressed it with somewhat       more determination still dreading lest some other person than       augustus might be in his stateroom the door however to my       astonishment remained steady and i became somewhat uneasy for       i knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to       remove it i pushed it stronglyit was nevertheless firm with       all my strengthit still did not give way with rage with fury       with despairit set at defiance my utmost efforts and it was       evident from the unyielding nature of the resistance that the       hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up or       that some immense weight had been placed upon it which it was       useless to think of removing        my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay in vain i       attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus       entombed i could summon up no connected chain of reflection       and sinking on the floor gave way unresistingly to the most       gloomy imaginings in which the dreadful deaths of thirst       famine suffocation and premature interment crowded upon me as       the prominent disasters to be encountered at length there       returned to me some portion of presence of mind i arose and       felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture       having found them i examined them closely to ascertain if they       emitted any light from the stateroom but none was visible i       then forced the blade of my penknife through them until i met       with some hard obstacle scraping against it i discovered it to       be a solid mass of iron which from its peculiar wavy feel as i       passed the blade along it i concluded to be a chaincable the       only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box and       there either yield to my sad fate or try so to tranquilize my       mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape i       immediately set about the attempt and succeeded after       innumerable difficulties in getting back as i sank utterly       exhausted upon the mattress tiger threw himself at full length       by my side and seemed as if desirous by his caresses of       consoling me in my troubles and urging me to bear them with       fortitude        the singularity of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my       attention after licking my face and hands for some minutes he       would suddenly cease doing so and utter a low whine upon       reaching out my hand toward him i then invariably found him       lying on his back with his paws uplifted this conduct so       frequently repeated appeared strange and i could in no manner       account for it as the dog seemed distressed i concluded that he       had received some injury and taking his paws in my hands i       examined them one by one but found no sign of any hurt i then       supposed him hungry and gave him a large piece of ham which he       devoured with avidityafterward however resuming his       extraordinary manoeuvres i now imagined that he was suffering       like myself the torments of thirst and was about adopting this       conclusion as the true one when the idea occurred to me that i       had as yet only examined his paws and that there might possibly       be a wound upon some portion of his body or head the latter i       felt carefully over but found nothing on passing my hand       however along his back i perceived a slight erection of the       hair extending completely across it probing this with my finger       i discovered a string and tracing it up found that it encircled       the whole body upon a closer scrutiny i came across a small       slip of what had the feeling of letter paper through which the       string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it       immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal     chapter          the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note       from augustus and that some unaccountable accident having       happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon he had       devised this method of acquainting me with the true state of       affairs trembling with eagerness i now commenced another search       for my phosphorus matches and tapers i had a confused       recollection of having put them carefully away just before       falling asleep and indeed previously to my last journey to the       trap i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had       deposited them but now i endeavored in vain to call it to mind       and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious       search for the missing articles never surely was there a more       tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense at length while       groping about with my head close to the ballast near the       opening of the box and outside of it i perceived a faint       glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage greatly       surprised i endeavored to make my way toward it as it appeared       to be but a few feet from my position scarcely had i moved with       this intention when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely and       before i could bring it into view again was obliged to feel       along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original       situation now moving my head with caution to and fro i found       that by proceeding slowly with great care in an opposite       direction to that in which i had at first started i was enabled       to draw near the light still keeping it in view presently i       came directly upon it having squeezed my way through innumerable       narrow windings and found that it proceeded from some fragments       of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side i       was wondering how they came in such a place when my hand fell       upon two or three pieces of taper wax which had been evidently       mumbled by the dog i concluded at once that he had devoured the       whole of my supply of candles and i felt hopeless of being ever       able to read the note of augustus the small remnants of the wax       were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel that i       despaired of deriving any service from them and left them as       they were the phosphorus of which there was only a speck or       two i gathered up as well as i could and returned with it       after much difficulty to my box where tiger had all the while       remained        what to do next i could not tell the hold was so intensely dark       that i could not see my hand however close i would hold it to my       face the white slip of paper could barely be discerned and not       even that when i looked at it directly by turning the exterior       portions of the retina toward itthat is to say by surveying it       slightly askance i found that it became in some measure       perceptible thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined and the       note of my friend if indeed it were a note from him seemed only       likely to throw me into further trouble by disquieting to no       purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind in vain i       revolved in my brain a multitude of absurd expedients for       procuring lightsuch expedients precisely as a man in the       perturbed sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for       a similar purposeeach and all of which appear by turns to the       dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of       conceptions just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties       flicker alternately one above the other at last an idea       occurred to me which seemed rational and which gave me cause to       wonder very justly that i had not entertained it before i       placed the slip of paper on the back of a book and collecting       the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from       the barrel laid them together upon the paper i then with the       palm of my hand rubbed the whole over quickly yet steadily a       clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole       surface and had there been any writing upon it i should not       have experienced the least difficulty i am sure in reading it       not a syllable was there howevernothing but a dreary and       unsatisfactory blank the illumination died away in a few       seconds and my heart died away within me as it went        i have before stated more than once that my intellect for some       period prior to this had been in a condition nearly bordering on       idiocy there were to be sure momentary intervals of perfect       sanity and now and then even of energy but these were few it       must be remembered that i had been for many days certainly       inhaling the almost pestilential atmosphere of a close hold in a       whaling vessel and for a long portion of that time but scantily       supplied with water for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had       nonenor had i slept during that time salt provisions of the       most exciting kind had been my chief and indeed since the loss       of the mutton my only supply of food with the exception of the       seabiscuit and these latter were utterly useless to me as they       were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched       condition of my throat i was now in a high state of fever and       in every respect exceedingly ill this will account for the fact       that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last       adventure with the phosphorus before the thought suggested       itself that i had examined only one side of the paper i shall       not attempt to describe my feelings of rage for i believe i was       more angry than any thing else when the egregious oversight i       had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception the blunder       itself would have been unimportant had not my own folly and       impetuosity rendered it otherwisein my disappointment at not       finding some words upon the slip i had childishly torn it in       pieces and thrown it away it was impossible to say where        from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the       sagacity of tiger having got after a long search a small piece       of the note i put it to the dogs nose and endeavored to make       him understand that he must bring me the rest of it to my       astonishment for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for       which his breed are famous he seemed to enter at once into my       meaning and rummaging about for a few moments soon found       another considerable portion bringing me this he paused awhile       and rubbing his nose against my hand appeared to be waiting for       my approval of what he had done i patted him on the head when       he immediately made off again it was now some minutes before he       came backbut when he did come he brought with him a large slip       which proved to be all the paper missingit having been torn it       seems only into three pieces luckily i had no trouble in       finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were leftbeing       guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still       emitted my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution       and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do it       was very probable i considered that some words were written       upon that side of the paper which had not been examinedbut which       side was that fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in       this respect although it assured me that the words if there       were any would be found all on one side and connected in a       proper manner as written there was the greater necessity of       ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt as the       phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third       attempt should i fail in the one i was now about to make i       placed the paper on a book as before and sat for some minutes       thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind at last i       thought it barely possible that the written side might have some       unevenness on its surface which a delicate sense of feeling       might enable me to detect i determined to make the experiment       and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first       presented itself nothing however was perceptible and i turned       the paper adjusting it on the book i now again carried my       forefinger cautiously along when i was aware of an exceedingly       slight but still discernable glow which followed as it       proceeded this i knew must arise from some very minute       remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered       the paper in my previous attempt the other or under side then       was that on which lay the writing if writing there should       finally prove to be again i turned the note and went to work as       i had previously done having rubbed in the phosphorus a       brilliancy ensued as beforebut this time several lines of ms in       a large hand and apparently in red ink became distinctly       visible the glimmer although sufficiently bright was but       momentary still had i not been too greatly excited there would       have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three       sentences before mefor i saw there were three in my anxiety       however to read all at once i succeeded only in reading the       seven concluding words which thus appearedbloodyour life       depends upon lying close        had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the notethe       full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted       to convey that admonition even although it should have revealed       a story of disaster the most unspeakable could not i am firmly       convinced have imbued my mind with one tithe of the harrowing       and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the       fragmentary warning thus received and blood too that word of       all wordsso rife at all times with mystery and suffering and       terrorhow trebly full of import did it now appearhow chilly and       heavily disjointed as it thus was from any foregoing words to       qualify or render it distinct did its vague syllables fall amid       the deep gloom of my prison into the innermost recesses of my       soul        augustus had undoubtedly good reasons for wishing me to remain       concealed and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could       bebut i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution       of the mystery just after returning from my last journey to the       trap and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the       singular conduct of tiger i had come to the resolution of making       myself heard at all events by those on board or if i could not       succeed in this directly of trying to cut my way through the       orlop deck the half certainty which i felt of being able to       accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency had       given me courage which i should not otherwise have had to       endure the evils of my situation the few words i had been able       to read however had cut me off from these final resources and       i now for the first time felt all the misery of my fate in a       paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress       where for about the period of a day and night i lay in a kind       of stupor relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and       recollection        at length i once more arose and busied myself in reflection upon       the horrors which encompassed me for another twentyfour hours       it was barely possible that i might exist without waterfor a       longer time i could not do so during the first portion of my       imprisonment i had made free use of the cordials with which       augustus had supplied me but they only served to excite fever       without in the least degree assuaging thirst i had now only       about a gill left and this was of a species of strong peach       liqueur at which my stomach revolted the sausages were entirely       consumed of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the       skin and all the biscuit except a few fragments of one had       been eaten by tiger to add to my troubles i found that my       headache was increasing momentarily and with it the species of       delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first       falling asleep for some hours past it had been with the greatest       difficulty i could breathe at all and now each attempt at so       doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of       the chest but there was still another and very different source       of disquietude and one indeed whose harassing terrors had been       the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the       mattress it arose from the demeanor of the dog        i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in       the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt as i rubbed he       ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl but i was too       greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the       circumstance soon afterward it will be remembered i threw       myself on the mattress and fell into a species of lethargy       presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my       ears and discovered it to proceed from tiger who was panting       and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement his       eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom i spoke to him       when he replied with a low growl and then remained quiet       presently i relapsed into my stupor from which i was again       awakened in a similar manner this was repeated three or four       times until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a       degree of fear that i became fully aroused he was now lying       close by the door of the box snarling fearfully although in a       kind of undertone and grinding his teeth as if strongly       convulsed i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the       confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad and i was at       a loss what course to pursue i could not endure the thought of       killing him yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own       safety i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me       with an expression of the most deadly animosity and i expected       every instant that he would attack me at last i could endure my       terrible situation no longer and determined to make my way from       the box at all hazards and dispatch him if his opposition       should render it necessary for me to do so to get out i had to       pass directly over his body and he already seemed to anticipate       my designmissing himself upon his forelegs as i perceived by       the altered position of his eyes and displayed the whole of his       white fangs which were easily discernible i took the remains of       the hamskin and the bottle containing the liqueur and secured       them about my person together with a large carvingknife which       augustus had left methen folding my cloak around me as closely       as possible i made a movement toward the mouth of the box no       sooner did i do this than the dog sprang with a loud growl       toward my throat the whole weight of his body struck me on the       right shoulder and i fell violently to the left while the       enraged animal passed entirely over me i had fallen upon my       knees with my head buried among the blankets and these       protected me from a second furious assault during which i felt       the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which       enveloped my neckyet luckily without being able to penetrate       all the folds i was now beneath the dog and a few moments would       place me completely in his power despair gave me strength and i       rose boldly up shaking him from me by main force and dragging       with me the blankets from the mattress these i now threw over       him and before he could extricate himself i had got through the       door and closed it effectually against his pursuit in this       struggle however i had been forced to drop the morsel of       hamskin and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to       a single gill of liqueur as this reflection crossed my mind i       felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which       might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar       circumstances and raising the bottle to my lips i drained it       to the last drop and dashed it furiously upon the floor        scarcely had the echo of the crash died away when i heard my       name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice issuing from the       direction of the steerage so unexpected was anything of the       kind and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the       sound that i endeavoured in vain to reply my powers of speech       totally failed and in an agony of terror lest my friend should       conclude me dead and return without attempting to reach me i       stood up between the crates near the door of the box trembling       convulsively and gasping and struggling for utterance had a       thousand words depended upon a syllable i could not have spoken       it there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber       somewhere forward of my station the sound presently grew less       distinct then again less so and still less shall i ever forget       my feelings at this moment he was goingmy friend my companion       from whom i had a right to expect so muchhe was goinghe would       abandon mehe was gone he would leave me to perish miserably to       expire in the most horrible and loathesome of dungeonsand one       word one little syllable would save meyet that single syllable       i could not utter i felt i am sure more than ten thousand       times the agonies of death itself my brain reeled and i fell       deadly sick against the end of the box        as i fell the carvingknife was shaken out from the waistband of       my pantaloons and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor       never did any strain of the richest melody come so sweetly to my       ears with the intensest anxiety i listened to ascertain the       effect of the noise upon augustusfor i knew that the person who       called my name could be no one but himself all was silent for       some moments at length i again heard the word arthur repeated       in a low tone and one full of hesitation reviving hope loosened       at once my powers of speech and i now screamed at the top of my       voice augustus oh augustus hush for gods sake be       silent he replied in a voice trembling with agitation i will       be with you immediatelyas soon as i can make my way through the       hold for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber and       every moment seemed to me an age at length i felt his hand upon       my shoulder and he placed at the same moment a bottle of water       to my lips those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the       jaws of the tomb or who have known the insufferable torments of       thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which       encompassed me in my dreary prison can form any idea of the       unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest       of all physical luxuries afforded        when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst augustus produced       from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes which i devoured       with the greatest avidity he had brought with him a light in a       dark lantern and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less       comfort than the food and drink but i was impatient to learn the       cause of his protracted absence and he proceeded to recount what       had happened on board during my incarceration     chapter          the brig put to sea as i had supposed in about an hour after he       had left the watch this was on the twentieth of june it will be       remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days and       during this period there was so constant a bustle on board and       so much running to and fro especially in the cabin and       staterooms that he had had no chance of visiting me without the       risk of having the secret of the trap discovered when at length       he did come i had assured him that i was doing as well as       possible and therefore for the two next days he felt but       little uneasiness on my accountstill however watching an       opportunity of going down it was not until the fourth day that       he found one several times during this interval he had made up       his mind to let his father know of the adventure and have me       come up at once but we were still within reaching distance of       nantucket and it was doubtful from some expressions which had       escaped captain barnard whether he would not immediately put       back if he discovered me to be on board besides upon thinking       the matter over augustus so he told me could not imagine that       i was in immediate want or that i would hesitate in such case       to make myself heard at the trap when therefore he considered       everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with       an opportunity of visiting me unobserved this as i said before       did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the       watch and the seventh since i had first entered the hold he       then went down without taking with him any water or provisions       intending in the first place merely to call my attention and get       me to come from the box to the trapwhen he would go up to the       stateroom and thence hand me down a supply when he descended for       this purpose he found that i was asleep for it seems that i was       snoring very loudly from all the calculations i can make on the       subject this must have been the slumber into which i fell just       after my return from the trap with the watch and which       consequently must have lasted for more than three entire days       and nights at the very least latterly i have had reason both       from my own experience and the assurance of others to be       acquainted with the strong soporific effects of the stench       arising from old fishoil when closely confined and when i think       of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned and the       long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling       vessel i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all after       once falling asleep than that i should have slept       uninterruptedly for the period specified above        augustus called to me at first in a low voice and without closing       the trapbut i made him no reply he then shut the trap and       spoke to me in a louder and finally in a very loud tonestill i       continued to snore he was now at a loss what to do it would       take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box       and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by captain       barnard who had occasion for his services every minute in       arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the       voyage he determined therefore upon reflection to ascend and       await another opportunity of visiting me he was the more easily       induced to this resolve as my slumber appeared to be of the most       tranquil nature and he could not suppose that i had undergone       any inconvenience from my incarceration he had just made up his       mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an       unusual bustle the sound of which proceeded apparently from the       cabin he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible closed       it and threw open the door of his stateroom no sooner had he       put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his       face and he was knocked down at the same moment by a blow from       a handspike        a strong hand held him on the cabin floor with a tight grasp       upon his throat still he was able to see what was going on       around him his father was tied hand and foot and lying along       the steps of the companionway with his head down and a deep       wound in the forehead from which the blood was flowing in a       continued stream he spoke not a word and was apparently dying       over him stood the first mate eyeing him with an expression of       fiendish derision and deliberately searching his pockets from       which he presently drew forth a large wallet and a chronometer       seven of the crew among whom was the cook a negro were       rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms where they       soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition besides       augustus and captain barnard there were nine men altogether in       the cabin and these among the most ruffianly of the brigs       company the villains now went upon deck taking my friend with       them after having secured his arms behind his back they       proceeded straight to the forecastle which was fastened downtwo       of the mutineers standing by it with axestwo also at the main       hatch the mate called out in a loud voice do you hear there       below tumble up with you one by onenow mark thatand no       grumbling it was some minutes before any one appearedat last       an englishman who had shipped as a raw hand came up weeping       piteously and entreating the mate in the most humble manner to       spare his life the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an       axe the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan and the       black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child and       tossed him deliberately into the sea hearing the blow and the       plunge of the body the men below could now be induced to venture       on deck neither by threats nor promises until a proposition was       made to smoke them out a general rush then ensued and for a       moment it seemed possible that the brig might be retaken the       mutineers however succeeded at last in closing the forecastle       effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up       these six finding themselves so greatly outnumbered and without       arms submitted after a brief struggle the mate gave them fair       wordsno doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield for       they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck the       result proved his sagacity no less than his diabolical villainy       all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of       submitting and ascending one by one were pinioned and then       thrown on their backs together with the first sixthere being in       all of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny       twentyseven        a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued the bound seamen       were dragged to the gangway here the cook stood with an axe       striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side       of the vessel by the other mutineers in this manner twentytwo       perished and augustus had given himself up for lost expecting       every moment his own turn to come next but it seemed that the       villains were now either weary or in some measure disgusted with       their bloody labour for the four remaining prisoners together       with my friend who had been thrown on the deck with the rest       were respited while the mate sent below for rum and the whole       murderous party held a drunken carouse which lasted until       sunset they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the       survivors who lay not more than four paces off and could       distinguish every word said upon some of the mutineers the       liquor appeared to have a softening effect for several voices       were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether on       condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits the       black cook however who in all respects was a perfect demon and       who seemed to exert as much influence if not more than the mate       himself would listen to no proposition of the kind and rose       repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway       fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be       easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party among       whom was a linemanager who went by the name of dirk peters       this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of       upsarokas who live among the fastnesses of the black hills near       the source of the missouri his father was a furtrader i       believe or at least connected in some manner with the indian       tradingposts on lewis river peters himself was one of the most       ferociouslooking men i ever beheld he was short in stature not       more than four feet eight inches high but his limbs were of       herculean mould his hands especially were so enormously thick       and broad as hardly to retain a human shape his arms as well as       legs were bowed in the most singular manner and appeared to       possess no flexibility whatever his head was equally deformed       being of immense size with an indentation on the crown like       that on the head of most negroes and entirely bald to conceal       this latter deficiency which did not proceed from old age he       usually wore a wig formed of any hairlike material which       presented itselfoccasionally the skin of a spanish dog or       american grizzly bear at the time spoken of he had on a portion       of one of these bearskins and it added no little to the natural       ferocity of his countenance which betook of the upsaroka       character the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear the lips       were thin and seemed like some other portions of his frame to       be devoid of natural pliancy so that the ruling expression never       varied under the influence of any emotion whatever this ruling       expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth       were exceedingly long and protruding and never even partially       covered in any instance by the lips to pass this man with a       casual glance one might imagine him to be convulsed with       laughter but a second look would induce a shuddering       acknowledgment that if such an expression were indicative of       merriment the merriment must be that of a demon of this       singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the seafaring       men of nantucket these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious       strength when under excitement and some of them had given rise       to a doubt of his sanity but on board the grampus it seems he       was regarded at the time of the mutiny with feelings more of       derision than of anything else i have been thus particular in       speaking of dirk peters because ferocious as he appeared he       proved the main instrument in preserving the life of augustus       and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him       hereafter in the course of my narrativea narrative let me here       say which in its latter portions will be found to include       incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human       experience and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human       credulity that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining       credence for all that i shall tell yet confidently trusting in       time and progressing science to verify some of the most important       and most improbable of my statements        after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels it was       determined at last that all the prisoners with the exception of       augustus whom peters insisted in a jocular manner upon keeping       as his clerk should be set adrift in one of the smallest       whaleboats the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain       barnard was still livingfor it will be remembered he was left       below when the mutineers came up presently the two made their       appearance the captain pale as death but somewhat recovered       from the effects of his wound he spoke to the men in a voice       hardly articulate entreated them not to set him adrift but to       return to their duty and promising to land them wherever they       chose and to take no steps for bringing them to justice he       might as well have spoken to the winds two of the ruffians       seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brigs side into       the boat which had been lowered while the mate went below the       four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered       to follow which they did without attempting any       resistanceaugustus being still left in his painful position       although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction       of being permitted to bid his father farewell a handful of       seabiscuit and a jug of water were now handed down but neither       mast sail oar nor compass the boat was towed astern for a few       minutes during which the mutineers held another consultationit       was then finally cut adrift by this time night had come onthere       were neither moon nor stars visibleand a short and ugly sea was       running although there was no great deal of wind the boat was       instantly out of sight and little hope could be entertained for       the unfortunate sufferers who were in it this event happened       however in latitude  degrees  north longitude  degrees        west and consequently at no very great distance from the       bermuda islands augustus therefore endeavored to console himself       with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the       land or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels       off the coast        all sail was now put upon the brig and she continued her       original course to the southwestthe mutineers being bent upon       some piratical expedition in which from all that could be       understood a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape       verd islands to porto rico no attention was paid to augustus       who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the       cabin companionway dirk peters treated him with some degree of       kindness and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the       cook his situation was still one of the most precarious as the       men were continually intoxicated and there was no relying upon       their continued goodhumor or carelessness in regard to himself       his anxiety on my account he represented however as the most       distressing result of his condition and indeed i had never       reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship more than once       he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my       being on board but was restrained from so doing partly through       recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld and partly       through a hope of being able soon to bring me relief for the       latter purpose he was constantly on the watch but in spite of       the most constant vigilance three days elapsed after the boat       was cut adrift before any chance occurred at length on the       night of the third day there came on a heavy blow from the       eastward and all hands were called up to take in sail during       the confusion which ensued he made his way below unobserved and       into the stateroom what was his grief and horror in discovering       that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a       variety of seastores and shipfurniture and that several       fathoms of old chaincable which had been stowed away beneath       the companionladder had been dragged thence to make room for a       chest and were now lying immediately upon the trap to remove it       without discovery was impossible and he returned on deck as       quickly as he could as he came up the mate seized him by the       throat and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin was       about flinging him over the larboard bulwark when his life was       again preserved through the interference of dirk peters augustus       was now put in handcuffs of which there were several pairs on       board and his feet lashed tightly together he was then taken       into the steerage and thrown into a lower berth next to the       forecastle bulkheads with the assurance that he should never put       his foot on deck again until the brig was no longer a brig       this was the expression of the cook who threw him into the       berthit is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended       by the phrase the whole affair however proved the ultimate       means of my relief as will presently appear     chapter          for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle augustus       abandoned himself to despair never hoping to leave the berth       alive he now came to the resolution of acquainting the first of       the men who should come down with my situation thinking it       better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of       thirst in the holdfor it had been ten days since i was first       imprisoned and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even       for four as he was thinking on this subject the idea came all       at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate       with me by the way of the main hold in any other circumstances       the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented       him from attempting it but now he had at all events little       prospect of life and consequently little to lose he bent his       whole mind therefore upon the task        his handcuffs were the first consideration at first he saw no       method of removing them and feared that he should thus be       baffled in the very outset but upon a closer scrutiny he       discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at       pleasure with very little effort or inconvenience merely by       squeezing his hands through themthis species of manacle being       altogether ineffectual in confining young persons in whom the       smaller bones readily yield to pressure he now untied his feet       and leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be       readjusted in the event of any persons coming down proceeded to       examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth the partition       here was of soft pine board an inch thick and he saw that he       should have little trouble in cutting his way through a voice       was now heard at the forecastle companionway and he had just       time to put his right hand into its handcuff the left had not       been removed and to draw the rope in a slipknot around his       ankle when dirk peters came below followed by tiger who       immediately leaped into the berth and lay down the dog had been       brought on board by augustus who knew my attachment to the       animal and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me       during the voyage he went up to our house for him immediately       after first taking me into the hold but did not think of       mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch since       the mutiny augustus had not seen him before his appearance with       dirk peters and had given him up for lost supposing him to have       been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging       to the mates gang it appeared afterward that he had crawled       into a hole beneath a whaleboat from which not having room to       turn round he could not extricate himself peters at last let       him out and with a species of good feeling which my friend knew       well how to appreciate had now brought him to him in the       forecastle as a companion leaving at the same time some salt       junk and potatoes with a can of water he then went on deck       promising to come down with something more to eat on the next       day        when he had gone augustus freed both hands from the manacles and       unfastened his feet he then turned down the head of the mattress       on which he had been lying and with his penknife for the       ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him commenced       cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks as closely       as possible to the floor of the berth he chose to cut here       because if suddenly interrupted he would be able to conceal       what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into       its proper position for the remainder of the day however no       disturbance occurred and by night he had completely divided the       plank it should here be observed that none of the crew occupied       the forecastle as a sleepingplace living altogether in the       cabin since the mutiny drinking the wines and feasting on the       seastores of captain barnard and giving no more heed than was       absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig these       circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and augustus for       had matters been otherwise he would have found it impossible to       reach me as it was he proceeded with confidence in his design       it was near daybreak however before he completed the second       division of the board which was about a foot above the first       cut thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his       passage through with facility to the main orlop deck having got       here he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main       hatch although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of       oilcasks piled nearly as high as the upper deck there being       barely room enough left for his body upon reaching the hatch he       found that tiger had followed him below squeezing between two       rows of the casks it was now too late however to attempt       getting to me before dawn as the chief difficulty lay in passing       through the close stowage in the lower hold he therefore       resolved to return and wait till the next night with this       design he proceeded to loosen the hatch so that he might have       as little detention as possible when he should come again no       sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small       opening produced snuffed for a moment and then uttered a long       whine scratching at the same time as if anxious to remove the       covering with his paws there could be no doubt from his       behaviour that he was aware of my being in the hold and       augustus thought it possible that he would be able to get to me       if he put him down he now hit upon the expedient of sending the       note as it was especially desirable that i should make no       attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing       circumstances and there could be no certainty of his getting to       me himself on the morrow as he intended afterevents proved how       fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did for       had it not been for the receipt of the note i should undoubtedly       have fallen upon some plan however desperate of alarming the       crew and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed       in consequence        having concluded to write the difficulty was now to procure the       materials for so doing an old toothpick was soon made into a       pen and this by means of feeling altogether for the       betweendecks was as dark as pitch paper enough was obtained       from the back of a lettera duplicate of the forged letter from       mr ross this had been the original draught but the handwriting       not being sufficiently well imitated augustus had written       another thrusting the first by good fortune into his       coatpocket where it was now most opportunely discovered ink       alone was thus wanting and a substitute was immediately found       for this by means of a slight incision with the penknife on the       back of a finger just above the naila copious flow of blood       ensuing as usual from wounds in that vicinity the note was now       written as well as it could be in the dark and under the       circumstances it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken       place that captain barnard was set adrift and that i might       expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned but       must not venture upon making any disturbance it concluded with       these words i have scrawled this with bloodyour life depends       upon lying close        this slip of paper being tied upon the dog he was now put down       the hatchway and augustus made the best of his way back to the       forecastle where he found no reason to believe that any of the       crew had been in his absence to conceal the hole in the       partition he drove his knife in just above it and hung up a       peajacket which he found in the berth his handcuffs were then       replaced and also the rope around his ankles        these arrangements were scarcely completed when dirk peters came       below very drunk but in excellent humour and bringing with him       my friends allowance of provision for the day this consisted of       a dozen large irish potatoes roasted and a pitcher of water he       sat for some time on a chest by the berth and talked freely       about the mate and the general concerns of the brig his       demeanour was exceedingly capricious and even grotesque at one       time augustus was much alarmed by odd conduct at last however       he went on deck muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good       dinner on the morrow during the day two of the crew harpooners       came down accompanied by the cook all three in nearly the last       stage of intoxication like peters they made no scruple of       talking unreservedly about their plans it appeared that they       were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course       agreeing in no point except the attack on the ship from the cape       verd islands with which they were in hourly expectation of       meeting as far as could be ascertained the mutiny had not been       brought about altogether for the sake of booty a private pique       of the chief mates against captain barnard having been the main       instigation there now seemed to be two principal factions among       the crewone headed by the mate the other by the cook the       former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which       should present itself and equipping it at some of the west india       islands for a piratical cruise the latter division however       which was the stronger and included dirk peters among its       partisans were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out       for the brig into the south pacific there either to take whale       or act otherwise as circumstances should suggest the       representations of peters who had frequently visited these       regions had great weight apparently with the mutineers       wavering as they were between halfengendered notions of profit       and pleasure he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to       be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific on the       perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed       but more particularly on the deliciousness of the climate on       the abundant means of good living and on the voluptuous beauty       of the women as yet nothing had been absolutely determined       upon but the pictures of the hybrid linemanager were taking       strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen and there       was every possibility that his intentions would be finally       carried into effect        the three men went away in about an hour and no one else entered       the forecastle all day augustus lay quiet until nearly night he       then freed himself from the rope and irons and prepared for his       attempt a bottle was found in one of the berths and this he       filled with water from the pitcher left by peters storing his       pockets at the same time with cold potatoes to his great joy he       also came across a lantern with a small piece of tallow candle       in it this he could light at any moment as he had in his       possession a box of phosphorus matches when it was quite dark       he got through the hole in the bulkhead having taken the       precaution to arrange the bedclothes in the berth so as to convey       the idea of a person covered up when through he hung up the       peajacket on his knife as before to conceal the aperturethis       manoeuvre being easily effected as he did not readjust the piece       of plank taken out until afterward he was now on the main orlop       deck and proceeded to make his way as before between the upper       deck and the oilcasks to the main hatchway having reached this       he lit the piece of candle and descended groping with extreme       difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold in a few       moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the       closeness of the atmosphere he could not think it possible that       i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so       oppressive an air he called my name repeatedly but i made him       no reply and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed the       brig was rolling violently and there was so much noise in       consequence that it was useless to listen for any weak sound       such as those of my breathing or snoring he threw open the       lantern and held it as high as possible whenever an opportunity       occurred in order that by observing the light i might if       alive be aware that succor was approaching still nothing was       heard from me and the supposition of my death began to assume       the character of certainty he determined nevertheless to force       a passage if possible to the box and at least ascertain beyond       a doubt the truth of his surmises he pushed on for some time in       a most pitiable state of anxiety until at length he found the       pathway utterly blocked up and that there was no possibility of       making any farther way by the course in which he had set out       overcome now by his feelings he threw himself among the lumber       in despair and wept like a child it was at this period that he       heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down       fortunate indeed was it that the incident occurredfor upon       this incident trivial as it appears the thread of my destiny       depended many years elapsed however before i was aware of this       fact a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision       prevented augustus from confiding to me at once what a more       intimate and unreserved communion afterward induced him to       reveal upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by       obstacles which he could not overcome he had resolved to abandon       his attempt at reaching me and return at once to the forecastle       before condemning him entirely on this head the harassing       circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into       consideration the night was fast wearing away and his absence       from the forecastle might be discovered and indeed would       necessarily be so if he should fail to get back to the berth by       daybreak his candle was expiring in the socket and there would       be the greatest difficulty in retracing his way to the hatchway       in the dark it must be allowed too that he had every good       reason to believe me dead in which event no benefit could result       to me from his reaching the box and a world of danger would be       encountered to no purpose by himself he had repeatedly called       and i had made him no answer i had been now eleven days and       nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he       had left with mea supply which it was not at all probable i had       hoarded in the beginning of my confinement as i had every cause       to expect a speedy release the atmosphere of the hold too must       have appeared to him coming from the comparatively open air of       the steerage of a nature absolutely poisonous and by far more       intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my       quarters in the boxthe hatchways at that time having been       constantly open for many months previous add to these       considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so       lately witnessed by my friend his confinement privations and       narrow escapes from death together with the frail and equivocal       tenure by which he still existedcircumstances all so well       calculated to prostrate every energy of mindand the reader will       be easily brought as i have been to regard his apparent falling       off in friendship and in faith with sentiments rather of sorrow       than of anger        the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard yet augustus was       not sure that it proceeded from the hold the doubt however was       sufficient inducement to persevere he clambered up nearly to the       orlop deck by means of the stowage and then watching for a lull       in the pitchings of the vessel he called out to me in as loud a       tone as he could command regardless for the moment of being       overheard by the crew it will be remembered that on this       occasion the voice reached me but i was so entirely overcome by       violent agitation as to be incapable of reply confident now       that his worst apprehensions were well founded he descended       with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of       time in his haste some small boxes were thrown down the noise       occasioned by which i heard as will be recollected he had made       considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife       again caused him to hesitate he retraced his steps immediately       and clambering up the stowage a second time called out my name       loudly as before having watched for a lull this time i found       voice to answer overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive       he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching       me having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the       labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in he at length       struck into an opening which promised better and finally after       a series of struggles arrived at the box in a state of utter       exhaustion     chapter          the leading particulars of this narration were all that augustus       communicated to me while we remained near the box it was not       until afterward that he entered fully into all the details he       was apprehensive of being missed and i was wild with impatience       to leave my detested place of confinement we resolved to make       our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead near which i was to       remain for the present while he went through to reconnoiter to       leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to       think of yet how to act otherwise was the question he now       seemed to be perfectly quiet and we could not even distinguish       the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the       box i was convinced that he was dead and determined to open the       door we found him lying at full length apparently in a deep       stupor yet still alive no time was to be lost yet i could not       bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice       instrumental in saving my life without some attempt at       preserving him we therefore dragged him along with us as well as       we could although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue       augustus during part of the time being forced to clamber over       the impediments in our way with the huge dog in his armsa feat       to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally       inadequate at length we succeeded in reaching the hole when       augustus got through and tiger was pushed in afterward all was       found to be safe and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to       god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped       for the present it was agreed that i should remain near the       opening through which my companion could readily supply me with       a part of his daily provision and where i could have the       advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure        in explanation of some portions of this narrative wherein i have       spoken of the stowage of the brig and which may appear ambiguous       to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular       stowage i must here state that the manner in which this most       important duty had been performed on board the grampus was a most       shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard who was       by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the       hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would       seem necessarily to demand a proper stowage cannot be       accomplished in a careless manner and many most disastrous       accidents even within the limits of my own experience have       arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular coasting       vessels in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking       in or discharging cargo are the most liable to mishap from the       want of a proper attention to stowage the great point is to       allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position       even in the most violent rollings of the vessel with this end       great attention must be paid not only to the bulk taken in but       to the nature of the bulk and whether there be a full or only a       partial cargo in most kinds of freight the stowage is       accomplished by means of a screw thus in a load of tobacco or       flour the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the       vessel that the barrels or hogsheads upon discharging are found       to be completely flattened and take some time to regain their       original shape this screwing however is resorted to       principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold for       in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco there       can be no danger of any shifting whatever at least none from       which inconvenience can result there have been instances       indeed where this method of screwing has resulted in the most       lamentable consequences arising from a cause altogether distinct       from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo a load of       cotton for example tightly screwed while in certain conditions       has been known through the expansion of its bulk to rend a       vessel asunder at sea there can be no doubt either that the same       result would ensue in the case of tobacco while undergoing its       usual course of fermentation were it not for the interstices       consequent upon the rotundity of the hogsheads        it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to       be apprehended from shifting and that precautions should be       always taken to guard against such misfortune only those who       have encountered a violent gale of wind or rather who have       experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the       gale can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges       and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose       articles in the vessel it is then that the necessity of a       cautious stowage when there is a partial cargo becomes obvious       when lyingto especially with a small head sail a vessel which       is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon       her beamends this occurring even every fifteen or twenty       minutes upon an average yet without any serious consequences       resulting provided there be a proper stowage if this however       has not been strictly attended to in the first of these heavy       lurches the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the       vessel which lies upon the water and being thus prevented from       regaining her equilibrium as she would otherwise necessarily do       she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down it is not       too much to say that at least onehalf of the instances in which       vessels have foundered in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to       a shifting of cargo or of ballast        when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board the whole       after being first stowed as compactly as may be should be       covered with a layer of stout shiftingboards extending       completely across the vessel upon these boards strong temporary       stanchions should be erected reaching to the timbers above and       thus securing every thing in its place in cargoes consisting of       grain or any similar matter additional precautions are       requisite a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port       will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its       destinationthis too although the freight when measured bushel       by bushel by the consignee will overrun by a vast deal on       account of the swelling of the grain the quantity consigned       this result is occasioned by settling during the voyage and is       the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the       weather experienced if grain loosely thrown in a vessel then       is ever so well secured by shiftingboards and stanchions it       will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring       about the most distressing calamities to prevent these every       method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo       as much as possible and for this there are many contrivances       among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the       grain even after all this is done and unusual pains taken to       secure the shiftingboards no seaman who knows what he is about       will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a       cargo of grain on board and least of all with a partial cargo       yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels and it is       likely many more from the ports of europe which sail daily with       partial cargoes even of the most dangerous species and without       any precaution whatever the wonder is that no more accidents       occur than do actually happen a lamentable instance of this       heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain joel       rice of the schooner firefly which sailed from richmond       virginia to madeira with a cargo of corn in the year  the       captain had gone many voyages without serious accident although       he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his       stowage more than to secure it in the ordinary manner he had       never before sailed with a cargo of grain and on this occasion       had the corn thrown on board loosely when it did not much more       than half fill the vessel for the first portion of the voyage he       met with nothing more than light breezes but when within a days       sail of madeira there came on a strong gale from the n n e       which forced him to lieto he brought the schooner to the wind       under a doublereefed foresail alone when she rode as well as       any vessel could be expected to do and shipped not a drop of       water toward night the gale somewhat abated and she rolled with       more unsteadiness than before but still did very well until a       heavy lurch threw her upon her beamends to starboard the corn       was then heard to shift bodily the force of the movement       bursting open the main hatchway the vessel went down like a       shot this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira       which picked up one of the crew the only person saved and       which rode out the gale in perfect security as indeed a jolly       boat might have done under proper management        the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done if       stowage that could be called which was little better than a       promiscuous huddling together of oilcasks  and ship       furniture i have already spoken of the condition of articles in       the hold on the orlop deck there was space enough for my body       as i have stated between the oilcasks and the upper deck a       space was left open around the main hatchway and several other       large spaces were left in the stowage near the hole cut through       the bulkhead by augustus there was room enough for an entire       cask and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for       the present        by the time my friend had got safely into the berth and       readjusted his handcuffs and the rope it was broad daylight we       had made a narrow escape indeed for scarcely had he arranged all       matters when the mate came below with dirk peters and the cook       they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape verds       and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance at       length the cook came to the berth in which augustus was lying       and seated himself in it near the head i could see and hear       every thing from my hidingplace for the piece cut out had not       been put back and i was in momentary expectation that the negro       would fall against the peajacket which was hung up to conceal       the aperture in which case all would have been discovered and       our lives would no doubt have been instantly sacrificed our       good fortune prevailed however and although he frequently       touched it as the vessel rolled he never pressed against it       sufficiently to bring about a discovery the bottom of the jacket       had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead so that the hole       might not be seen by its swinging to one side all this time       tiger was lying in the foot of the berth and appeared to have       recovered in some measure his faculties for i could see him       occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath        after a few minutes the mate and cook went above leaving dirk       peters behind who as soon as they were gone came and sat       himself down in the place just occupied by the mate he began to       talk very sociably with augustus and we could now see that the       greater part of his apparent intoxication while the two others       were with him was a feint he answered all my companions       questions with perfect freedom told him that he had no doubt of       his fathers having been picked up as there were no less than       five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut       adrift and used other language of a consolatory nature which       occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure indeed i began to       entertain hopes that through the instrumentality of peters we       might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig and       this idea i mentioned to augustus as soon as i found an       opportunity he thought the matter possible but urged the       necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt as the       conduct of the hybrid appeared to be instigated by the most       arbitrary caprice alone and indeed it was difficult to say if       he was at any moment of sound mind peters went upon deck in       about an hour and did not return again until noon when he       brought augustus a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding of       this when we were left alone i partook heartily without       returning through the hole no one else came down into the       forecastle during the day and at night i got into augustus       berth where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak       when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck and i regained       my hidingplace as quickly as possible when the day was fully       broke we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost       entirely and gave no indications of hydrophobia drinking a       little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness       during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite       his strange conduct had been brought on no doubt by the       deleterious quality of the air of the hold and had no connexion       with canine madness i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had       persisted in bringing him with me from the box this day was the       thirtieth of june and the thirteenth since the grampus made sail       from nantucket        on the second of july the mate came below drunk as usual and in       an excessively goodhumor he came to augustuss berth and       giving him a slap on the back asked him if he thought he could       behave himself if he let him loose and whether he would promise       not to be going into the cabin again to this of course my       friend answered in the affirmative when the ruffian set him at       liberty after making him drink from a flask of rum which he drew       from his coatpocket both now went on deck and i did not see       augustus for about three hours he then came below with the good       news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he       pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast and that he had been       ordered to sleep as usual in the forecastle he brought me       too a good dinner and a plentiful supply of water the brig was       still cruising for the vessel from the cape verds and a sail was       now in sight which was thought to be the one in question as the       events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance and       had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative i       will here throw them into the form of a journal as i do not wish       to omit them altogether        july  augustus furnished me with three blankets with which i       contrived a comfortable bed in my hidingplace no one came       below except my companion during the day tiger took his       station in the berth just by the aperture and slept heavily as       if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness       toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be       taken in and very nearly capsized her the puff died away       immediately however and no damage was done beyond the splitting       of the foretopsail dirk peters treated augustus all this day       with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him       respecting the pacific ocean and the islands he had visited in       that region he asked him whether he would not like to go with       the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those       quarters and said that the men were gradually coming over to the       mates views to this augustus thought it best to reply that he       would be glad to go on such an adventure since nothing better       could be done and that any thing was preferable to a piratical       life        july th the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from       liverpool and was allowed to pass unmolested augustus spent       most of his time on deck with a view of obtaining all the       information in his power respecting the intentions of the       mutineers they had frequent and violent quarrels among       themselves in one of which a harpooner jim bonner was thrown       overboard the party of the mate was gaining ground jim bonner       belonged to the cooks gang of which peters was a partisan        july th about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the       west which at noon freshened into a gale so that the brig could       carry nothing more than her trysail and foresail in taking in       the foretopsail simms one of the common hands and belonging       also to the cooks gang fell overboard being very much in       liquor and was drownedno attempt being made to save him the       whole number of persons on board was now thirteen to wit dirk       peters seymour the black cook jones greely hartman rogers       and william allen all of the cooks party the mate whose name       i never learned absalom hicks wilson john hunty richard       parker of the mates partybesides augustus and myself        july th the gale lasted all this day blowing in heavy squalls       accompanied with rain the brig took in a good deal of water       through her seams and one of the pumps was kept continually       going augustus being forced to take his turn just at twilight a       large ship passed close by us without having been discovered       until within hail the ship was supposed to be the one for which       the mutineers were on the lookout the mate hailed her but the       reply was drowned in the roaring of the gale at eleven a sea       was shipped amidships which tore away a great portion of the       larboard bulwarks and did some other slight damage toward       morning the weather moderated and at sunrise there was very       little wind        july th there was a heavy swell running all this day during       which the brig being light rolled excessively and many       articles broke loose in the hold as i could hear distinctly from       my hidingplace i suffered a great deal from seasickness       peters had a long conversation this day with augustus and told       him that two of his gang greely and allen had gone over to the       mate and were resolved to turn pirates he put several questions       to augustus which he did not then exactly understand during a       part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel and little       could be done to remedy it as it was occasioned by the brigs       straining and taking in the water through her seams a sail was       thrummed and got under the bows which aided us in some measure       so that we began to gain upon the leak        july th a light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward       when the mate headed the brig to the southwest with the       intention of making some of the west india islands in pursuance       of his piratical designs no opposition was made by peters or the       cookat least none in the hearing of augustus all idea of taking       the vessel from the cape verds was abandoned the leak was now       easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an       hour the sail was drawn from beneath the bows spoke two small       schooners during the day        july th fine weather all hands employed in repairing bulwarks       peters had again a long conversation with augustus and spoke       more plainly than he had done heretofore he said nothing should       induce him to come into the mates views and even hinted his       intention of taking the brig out of his hands he asked my friend       if he could depend upon his aid in such case to which augustus       said yes without hesitation peters then said he would sound       the others of his party upon the subject and went away during       the remainder of the day augustus had no opportunity of speaking       with him privately     chapter          july  spoke a brig from rio bound to norfolk weather hazy       with a light baffling wind from the eastward today hartman       rogers died having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after       drinking a glass of grog this man was of the cooks party and       one upon whom peters placed his main reliance he told augustus       that he believed the mate had poisoned him and that he expected       if he did not be on the lookout his own turn would come       shortly there were now only himself jones and the cook       belonging to his own gangon the other side there were five he       had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate but       the project having been coolly received he had been deterred       from pressing the matter any further or from saying any thing to       the cook it was well as it happened that he was so prudent       for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of       siding with the mate and went over formally to that party while       jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters and hinted       that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation there       was now evidently no time to be lost and peters expressed his       determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards       provided augustus would lend him his aid my friend at once       assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that       purpose and thinking the opportunity a favourable one made       known the fact of my being on board at this the hybrid was not       more astonished than delighted as he had no reliance whatever       upon jones whom he already considered as belonging to the party       of the mate they went below immediately when augustus called to       me by name and peters and myself were soon made acquainted it       was agreed that we should attempt to retake the vessel upon the       first good opportunity leaving jones altogether out of our       councils in the event of success we were to run the brig into       the first port that offered and deliver her up the desertion of       his party had frustrated peters design of going into the       pacifican adventure which could not be accomplished without a       crew and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial       on the score of insanity which he solemnly avowed had actuated       him in lending his aid to the mutiny or upon obtaining a       pardon if found guilty through the representations of augustus       and myself our deliberations were interrupted for the present by       the cry of all hands take in sail and peters and augustus ran       up on deck        as usual the crew were nearly all drunk and before sail could       be properly taken in a violent squall laid the brig on her       beamends by keeping her away however she righted having       shipped a good deal of water scarcely was everything secure       when another squall took the vessel and immediately afterward       anotherno damage being done there was every appearance of a       gale of wind which indeed shortly came on with great fury       from the northward and westward all was made as snug as       possible and we laidto as usual under a closereefed       foresail as night drew on the wind increased in violence with       a remarkably heavy sea peters now came into the forecastle with       augustus and we resumed our deliberations        we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the       present for carrying our designs into effect as an attempt at       such a moment would never be anticipated as the brig was snugly       laidto there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until       good weather when if we succeeded in our attempt we might       liberate one or perhaps two of the men to aid us in taking her       into port the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our       forces there were only three of us and in the cabin there were       nine all the arms on board too were in their possession with       the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had       concealed about his person and the large seamans knife which he       always wore in the waistband of his pantaloons from certain       indications toosuch for example as there being no such thing       as an axe or a handspike lying in their customary placeswe began       to fear that the mate had his suspicions at least in regard to       peters and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid       of him it was clear indeed that what we should determine to do       could not be done too soon still the odds were too much against       us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution        peters proposed that he should go up on deck and enter into       conversation with the watch allen when he would be able to       throw him into the sea without trouble and without making any       disturbance by seizing a good opportunity that augustus and       myself should then come up and endeavour to provide ourselves       with some kind of weapons from the deck and that we should then       make a rush together and secure the companionway before any       opposition could be offered i objected to this because i could       not believe that the mate who was a cunning fellow in all       matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices would       suffer himself to be so easily entrapped the very fact of there       being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was       upon the alertit not being usual except in vessels where       discipline is most rigidly enforced to station a watch on deck       when a vessel is lyingto in a gale of wind as i address myself       principally if not altogether to persons who have never been to       sea it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel       under such circumstances lyingto or in seaparlance       layingto is a measure resorted to for various purposes and       effected in various manners in moderate weather it is frequently       done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a standstill       to wait for another vessel or any similar object if the vessel       which liesto is under full sail the manoeuvre is usually       accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails so as       to let the wind take them aback when she becomes stationary but       we are now speaking of lyingto in a gale of wind this is done       when the wind is ahead and too violent to admit of carrying sail       without danger of capsizing and sometimes even when the wind is       fair but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it       if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy       sea much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water       over her stern and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes       forward this manoeuvre then is seldom resorted to in such       case unless through necessity when the vessel is in a leaky       condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest       seas for when lyingto her seams are sure to be greatly opened       by her violent straining and it is not so much the case when       scudding often too it becomes necessary to scud a vessel       either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in       pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her       head to the wind or when through the false modelling of the       frame or other causes this main object cannot be effected        vessels in a gale of wind are laidto in different manners       according to their peculiar construction some lieto best under       a foresail and this i believe is the sail most usually       employed large squarerigged vessels have sails for the express       purpose called stormstaysails but the jib is occasionally       employed by itselfsometimes the jib and foresail or a       doublereefed foresail and not unfrequently the aftersails are       made use of foretopsails are very often found to answer the       purpose better than any other species of sail the grampus was       generally laidto under a closereefed foresail        when a vessel is to be laidto her head is brought up to the       wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when       hauled flat aft that is when brought diagonally across the       vessel this being done the bows point within a few degrees of       the direction from which the wind issues and the windward bow of       course receives the shock of the waves in this situation a good       vessel will ride out a very heavy gale of wind without shipping a       drop of water and without any further attention being requisite       on the part of the crew the helm is usually lashed down but       this is altogether unnecessary except on account of the noise it       makes when loose for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel       when lyingto indeed the helm had far better be left loose than       lashed very fast for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy       seas if there be no room for the helm to play as long as the       sail holds a well modelled vessel will maintain her situation       and ride every sea as if instinct with life and reason if the       violence of the wind however should tear the sail into pieces       a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under       ordinary circumstances there is then imminent danger the       vessel falls off from the wind and coming broadside to the sea       is completely at its mercy the only resource in this case is to       put her quietly before the wind letting her scud until some       other sail can be set some vessels will lieto under no sail       whatever but such are not to be trusted at sea        but to return from this digression it had never been customary       with the mate to have any watch on deck when lyingto in a gale       of wind and the fact that he had now one coupled with the       circumstance of the missing axes and handspikes fully convinced       us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by       surprise in the manner peters had suggested something however       was to be done and that with as little delay as practicable for       there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once       entertained against peters he would be sacrificed upon the       earliest occasion and one would certainly be either found or       made upon the breaking of the gale        augustus now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove       under any pretext the piece of chaincable which lay over the       trap in the stateroom we might possibly be able to come upon       them unawares by means of the hold but a little reflection       convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for       any attempt of that nature        by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the       superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate it will       be remembered that one of the crew hartman rogers had died       during the morning having been attacked two days before with       spasms after drinking some spirits and water peters had       expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by       the mate and for this belief he had reasons so he said which       were incontrovertible but which he could not be prevailed upon       to explain to usthis wayward refusal being only in keeping with       other points of his singular character but whether or not he had       any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves       we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion and determined       to act accordingly        rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon in violent       convulsions and the corpse presented in a few minutes after       death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever       remember to have seen the stomach was swollen immensely like       that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many       weeks the hands were in the same condition while the face was       shrunken shrivelled and of a chalky whiteness except where       relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those       occasioned by the erysipelas one of these blotches extended       diagonally across the face completely covering up an eye as if       with a band of red velvet in this disgusting condition the body       had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown       overboard when the mate getting a glimpse of it for he now saw       it for the first time and being either touched with remorse for       his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight ordered       the men to sew the body up in its hammock and allow it the usual       rites of seaburial having given these directions he went       below as if to avoid any further sight of his victim while       preparations were making to obey his orders the gale came on       with great fury and the design was abandoned for the present       the corpse left to itself was washed into the larboard       scuppers where it still lay at the time of which i speak       floundering about with the furious lurches of the brig        having arranged our plan we set about putting it in execution as       speedily as possible peters went upon deck and as he had       anticipated was immediately accosted by allen who appeared to       be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any       other purpose the fate of this villain however was speedily       and silently decided for peters approaching him in a careless       manner as if about to address him seized him by the throat       and before he could utter a single cry tossed him over the       bulwarks he then called to us and we came up our first       precaution was to look about for something with which to arm       ourselves and in doing this we had to proceed with great care       for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding       fast and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge       forward it was indispensable too that we should be quick in       our operations for every minute we expected the mate to be up to       set the pumps going as it was evident the brig must be taking in       water very fast after searching about for some time we could       find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two pumphandles       one of which augustus took and i the other having secured       these we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the       body overboard peters and myself then went below leaving       augustus to watch upon deck where he took his station just where       allen had been placed and with his back to the cabin       companionway so that if any of the mates gang should come up       he might suppose it was the watch        as soon as i got below i commenced disguising myself so as to       represent the corpse of rogers the shirt which we had taken from       the body aided us very much for it was of singular form and       character and easily recognizablea kind of smock which the       deceased wore over his other clothing it was a blue stockinett       with large white stripes running across having put this on i       proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach in imitation of       the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse this was soon       effected by means of stuffing with some bedclothes i then gave       the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white       woollen mittens and filling them in with any kind of rags that       offered themselves peters then arranged my face first rubbing       it well over with white chalk and afterward blotching it with       blood which he took from a cut in his finger the streak across       the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking       appearance     chapter          as i viewed myself in a fragment of lookingglass which hung up       in the cabin and by the dim light of a kind of battlelantern i       was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance and       at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus       representing that i was seized with a violent tremour and could       scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part it was       necessary however to act with decision and peters and myself       went upon deck        we there found everything safe and keeping close to the       bulwarks the three of us crept to the cabin companionway it       was only partially closed precautions having been taken to       prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without by means of       placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with       the shutting we found no difficulty in getting a full view of       the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges       were placed it now proved to have been very fortunate for us       that we had not attempted to take them by surprise for they were       evidently on the alert only one was asleep and he lying just at       the foot of the companionladder with a musket by his side the       rest were seated on several mattresses which had been taken from       the berths and thrown on the floor they were engaged in earnest       conversation and although they had been carousing as appeared       from two empty jugs with some tin tumblers which lay about they       were not as much intoxicated as usual all had knives one or two       of them pistols and a great many muskets were lying in a berth       close at hand        we listened to their conversation for some time before we could       make up our minds how to act having as yet resolved on nothing       determinate except that we would attempt to paralyze their       exertions when we should attack them by means of the apparition       of rogers they were discussing their piratical plans in which       all we could hear distinctly was that they would unite with the       crew of a schooner hornet and if possible get the schooner       herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a       large scale the particulars of which could not be made out by       either of us        one of the men spoke of peters when the mate replied to him in a       low voice which could not be distinguished and afterward added       more loudly that he could not understand his being so much       forward with the captains brat in the forecastle and he thought       the sooner both of them were overboard the better to this no       answer was made but we could easily perceive that the hint was       well received by the whole party and more particularly by jones       at this period i was excessively agitated the more so as i could       see that neither augustus nor peters could determine how to act       i made up my mind however to sell my life as dearly as       possible and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings       of trepidation        the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the       rigging and the washing of the sea over the deck prevented us       from hearing what was said except during momentary lulls in one       of these we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to       go forward have an eye upon them for he wanted no such secret       doings on board the brig it was well for us that the pitching       of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this       order from being carried into instant execution the cook got up       from his mattress to go for us when a tremendous lurch which i       thought would carry away the masts threw him headlong against       one of the larboard stateroom doors bursting it open and       creating a good deal of other confusion luckily neither of our       party was thrown from his position and we had time to make a       precipitate retreat to the forecastle and arrange a hurried plan       of action before the messenger made his appearance or rather       before he put his head out of the companionhatch for he did not       come on deck from this station he could not notice the absence       of allen and he accordingly bawled out as if to him repeating       the orders of the mate peters cried out ay ay in a       disguised voice and the cook immediately went below without       entertaining a suspicion that all was not right        my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the       cabin peters closing the door after him in the same manner he       had found it the mate received them with feigned cordiality and       told augustus that since he had behaved himself so well of late       he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for       the future he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum       and made him drink it all this i saw and heard for i followed       my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut and took up       my old point of observation i had brought with me the two       pumphandles one of which i secured near the companionway to       be ready for use when required        i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good       view of all that was passing within and endeavoured to nerve       myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters       should make a signal to me as agreed upon presently he       contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the       mutiny and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand       superstitions which are so universally current among seamen i       could not make out all that was said but i could plainly see the       effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present       the mate was evidently much agitated and presently when some       one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers corpse i       thought he was upon the point of swooning peters now asked him       if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown       overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it       floundering about in the scuppers at this the villain absolutely       gasped for breath and turned his head slowly round upon his       companions as if imploring some one to go up and perform the       task no one however stirred and it was quite evident that the       whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous       excitement peters now made me the signal i immediately threw       open the door of the companionway and descending without       uttering a syllable stood erect in the midst of the party        the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at       all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken       into consideration usually in cases of a similar nature there       is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as       to the reality of the vision before his eyes a degree of hope       however feeble that he is the victim of chicanery and that the       apparition is not actually a visitant from the old world of       shadows it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt       have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation and that       the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about is       to be attributed even in the cases most in point and where most       suffering has been experienced more to a kind of anticipative       horror lest the apparition might possibly be real than to an       unwavering belief in its reality but in the present instance       it will be seen immediately that in the minds of the mutineers       there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a       doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a revivification       of his disgusting corpse or at least its spiritual image the       isolated situation of the brig with its entire inaccessibility       on account of the gale confined the apparently possible means of       deception within such narrow and definite limits that they must       have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance       they had now been at sea twentyfour days without holding more       than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever the whole       of the crew tooat least all whom they had the most remote       reason for suspecting to be on boardwere assembled in the cabin       with the exception of allen the watch and his gigantic stature       he was six feet six inches high was too familiar in their eyes       to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to       enter their minds even for an instant add to these       considerations the aweinspiring nature of the tempest and that       of the conversation brought about by peters the deep impression       which the loathsomeness of the actual corpse had made in the       morning upon the imaginations of the men the excellence of the       imitation in my person and the uncertain and wavering light in       which they beheld me as the glare of the cabin lantern swinging       violently to and fro fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure       and there will be no reason to wonder that the deception had even       more than the entire effect which we had anticipated the mate       sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying and without       uttering a syllable fell back stone dead upon the cabin floor       and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the       brig of the remaining seven there were but three who had at       first any degree of presence of mind the four others sat for       some time rooted apparently to the floor the most pitiable       objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered the       only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook john       hunt and richard parker but they made but a feeble and       irresolute defence the two former were shot instantly by peters       and i felled parker with a blow on the head from the pumphandle       which i had brought with me in the meantime augustus seized one       of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer       wilson through the breast there were now but three remaining       but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy and       perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon       them for they fought with great resolution and fury and but       for the immense muscular strength of peters might have       ultimately got the better of us these three men werejones       greely and absolom hicks jones had thrown augustus to the       floor stabbed him in several places along the right arm and       would no doubt have soon dispatched him as neither peters nor       myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists had it       not been for the timely aid of a friend upon whose assistance       we surely had never depended this friend was no other than       tiger with a low growl he bounded into the cabin at a most       critical moment for augustus and throwing himself upon jones       pinned him to the floor in an instant my friend however was       now too much injured to render us any aid whatever and i was so       encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little the dog       would not leave his hold upon the throat of jonespeters       nevertheless was far more than a match for the two men who       remained and would no doubt have dispatched them sooner had       it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act and the       tremendous lurches of the vessel presently he was enabled to get       hold of a heavy stool several of which lay about the floor with       this he beat out the brains of greely as he was in the act of       discharging a musket at me and immediately afterward a roll of       the brig throwing him in contact with hicks he seized him by the       throat and by dint of sheer strength strangled him       instantaneously thus in far less time than i have taken to tell       it we found ourselves masters of the brig        the only person of our opponents who was left alive was richard       parker this man it will be remembered i had knocked down with       a blow from the pumphandle at the commencement of the attack he       now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom but       upon peters touching him with his foot he spoke and entreated       for mercy his head was only slightly cut and otherwise he had       received no injury having been merely stunned by the blow he       now got up and for the present we secured his hands behind his       back the dog was still growling over jones but upon       examination we found him completely dead the blood issuing in a       stream from a deep wound in the throat inflicted no doubt by       the sharp teeth of the animal        it was now about one oclock in the morning and the wind was       still blowing tremendously the brig evidently laboured much more       than usual and it became absolutely necessary that something       should be done with a view of easing her in some measure at       almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea several of which       came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle the       hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended the       entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away as well       as the caboose together with the jollyboat from the counter the       creaking and working of the mainmast too gave indication that       it was nearly sprung to make room for more stowage in the       afterhold the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks       a very reprehensible practice occasionally resorted to by       ignorant shipbuilders so that it was in imminent danger of       working from its step but to crown all our difficulties we       plummed the well and found no less than seven feet of water        leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin we got to work       immediately at the pumpsparker of course being set at liberty       to assist us in the labour augustuss arm was bound up as well       as we could effect it and he did what he could but that was not       much however we found that we could just manage to keep the       leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going as       there were only four of us this was severe labour but we       endeavoured to keep up our spirits and looked anxiously for       daybreak when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the       mainmast        in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue       and when the day at length broke the gale had neither abated in       the least nor were there any signs of its abating we now       dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard our next       care was to get rid of the mainmast the necessary preparations       having been made peters cut away at the mast having found axes       in the cabin while the rest of us stood by the stays and       lanyards as the brig gave a tremendous leelurch the word was       given to cut away the weatherlanyards which being done the       whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea clear of the       brig and without doing any material injury we now found that       the vessel did not labour quite as much as before but our       situation was still exceedingly precarious and in spite of the       utmost exertions we could not gain upon the leak without the aid       of both pumps the little assistance which augustus could render       us was not really of any importance to add to our distress a       heavy sea striking the brig to the windward threw her off       several points from the wind and before she could regain her       position another broke completely over her and hurled her full       upon her beamends the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward       the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some       time and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us       from capsizing presently however we partially righted but the       ballast still retaining its place to larboard we lay so much       along that it was useless to think of working the pumps which       indeed we could not have done much longer in any case as our       hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had       undergone and were bleeding in the most horrible manner        contrary to parkers advice we now proceeded to cut away the       foremast and at length accomplished it after much difficulty       owing to the position in which we lay in going overboard the       wreck took with it the bowsprit and left us a complete hulk        so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our       longboat which had received no damage from any of the huge seas       which had come on board but we had not long to congratulate       ourselves for the foremast having gone and of course the       foresail with it by which the brig had been steadied every sea       now made a complete breach over us and in five minutes our deck       was swept from stem to stern the longboat and starboard bulwarks       torn off and even the windlass shattered into fragments it was       indeed hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable       condition        at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the gales       abating but in this we were sadly disappointed for it only       lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury about four       in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against       the violence of the blast and as the night closed in upon us i       had not a shadow of hope that the vessel would hold together       until morning        by midnight we had settled very deep in the water which was now       up to the orlop deck the rudder went soon afterward the sea       which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely       from the water against which she thumped in her descent with       such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore we had       all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last as       it was unusually strong being rigged as i have never seen one       rigged either before or since down its main timber there ran a       succession of stout iron hooks and others in the same manner       down the sternpost through these hooks there extended a very       thick wroughtiron rod the rudder being thus held to the       sternpost and swinging freely on the rod the tremendous force       of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact that       the hooks in the sternpost which ran entirely through it being       clinched on the inside were drawn every one of them completely       out of the solid wood        we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this       shock when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever       known broke right on board of us sweeping the companionway       clear off bursting in the hatchways and filling every inch of       the vessel with water     chapter          luckily just before night all four of us had lashed ourselves       firmly to the fragments of the windlass lying in this manner as       flat upon the deck as possible this precaution alone saved us       from destruction as it was we were all more or less stunned by       the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us and which did       not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted as soon as       i could recover breath i called aloud to my companions augustus       alone replied saying it is all over with us and may god have       mercy upon our souls byandby both the others were enabled to       speak when they exhorted us to take courage as there was still       hope it being impossible from the nature of the cargo that the       brig could go down and there being every chance that the gale       would blow over by the morning these words inspired me with new       life for strange as it may seem although it was obvious that a       vessel with a cargo of empty oilcasks would not sink i had been       hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this       consideration altogether and the danger which i had for some       time regarded as the most imminent was that of foundering as       hope revived within me i made use of every opportunity to       strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the       windlass and in this occupation i soon discovered that my       companions were also busy the night was as dark as it could       possibly be and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which       surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing our deck lay       level with the sea or rather we were encircled with a towering       ridge of foam a portion of which swept over us every instant it       is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the       water more than one second in three although we lay close       together no one of us could see the other or indeed any       portion of the brig itself upon which we were so tempestuously       hurled about at intervals we called one to the other thus       endeavouring to keep alive hope and render consolation and       encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it the       feeble condition of augustus made him an object of solicitude       with us all and as from the lacerated condition of his right       arm it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings       with any degree of firmness we were in momentary expectation of       finding that he had gone overboardyet to render him aid was a       thing altogether out of the question fortunately his station       was more secure than that of any of the rest of us for the upper       part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered       windlass the seas as they tumbled in upon him were greatly       broken in their violence in any other situation than this into       which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself       in a very exposed spot he must inevitably have perished before       morning owing to the brigs lying so much along we were all       less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the       case the heel as i have before stated was to larboard about       one half of the deck being constantly under water the seas       therefore which struck us to starboard were much broken by the       vessels side only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on       our faces while those which came from larboard being what are       called backwater seas and obtaining little hold upon us on       account of our posture had not sufficient force to drag us from       our fastenings        in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to       show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us the brig was       a mere log rolling about at the mercy of every wave the gale       was upon the increase if any thing blowing indeed a complete       hurricane and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of       deliverance for several hours we held on in silence expecting       every moment that our lashings would either give way that the       remains of the windlass would go by the board or that some of       the huge seas which roared in every direction around us and       above us would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we       should be drowned before it could regain the surface by the       mercy of god however we were preserved from these imminent       dangers and about midday were cheered by the light of the       blessed sun shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible       diminution in the force of the wind when now for the first time       since the latter part of the evening before augustus spoke       asking peters who lay closest to him if he thought there was       any possibility of our being saved as no reply was at first made       to this question we all concluded that the hybrid had been       drowned where he lay but presently to our great joy he spoke       although very feebly saying that he was in great pain being so       cut by the tightness of his lashings across the stomach that he       must either find means of loosening them or perish as it was       impossible that he could endure his misery much longer this       occasioned us great distress as it was altogether useless to       think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing       over us as it did we exhorted him to bear his sufferings with       fortitude and promised to seize the first opportunity which       should offer itself to relieve him he replied that it would soon       be too late that it would be all over with him before we could       help him and then after moaning for some minutes lay silent       when we concluded that he had perished        as the evening drew on the sea had fallen so much that scarcely       more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the       course of five minutes and the wind had abated a great deal       although still blowing a severe gale i had not heard any of my       companions speak for hours and now called to augustus he       replied although very feebly so that i could not distinguish       what he said i then spoke to peters and to parker neither of       whom returned any answer        shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial       insensibility during which the most pleasing images floated in       my imagination such as green trees waving meadows of ripe       grain processions of dancing girls troops of cavalry and other       phantasies i now remember that in all which passed before my       minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied       any stationary object such as a house a mountain or any thing       of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people       on horseback carriages driving furiously and similar moving       objects presented themselves in endless succession when i       recovered from this state the sun was as near as i could guess       an hour high i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to       recollection the various circumstances connected with my       situation and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was       still in the hold of the brig near the box and that the body of       parker was that of tiger        when i at length completely came to my senses i found that the       wind blew no more than a moderate breeze and that the sea was       comparatively calm so much so that it only washed over the brig       amidships my left arm had broken loose from its lashings and       was much cut about the elbow my right was entirely benumbed and       the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the       rope which had worked from the shoulder downward i was also in       great pain from another rope which went about my waist and had       been drawn to an insufferable degree of tightness looking round       upon my companions i saw that peters still lived although a       thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him       the appearance of being cut nearly in two as i stirred he made       a feeble motion to me with his hand pointing to the rope       augustus gave no indication of life whatever and was bent nearly       double across a splinter of the windlass parker spoke to me when       he saw me moving and asked me if i had not sufficient strength       to release him from his situation saying that if i would summon       up what spirits i could and contrive to untie him we might yet       save our lives but that otherwise we must all perish i told him       to take courage and i would endeavor to free him feeling in my       pantaloons pocket i got hold of my penknife and after several       ineffectual attempts at length succeeded in opening it i then       with my left hand managed to free my right from its fastenings       and afterward cut the other ropes which held me upon attempting       however to move from my position i found that my legs failed me       altogether and that i could not get up neither could i move my       right arm in any direction upon mentioning this to parker he       advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes holding on to the       windlass with my left hand so as to allow time for the blood to       circulate doing this the numbness presently began to die away       so that i could move first one of my legs and then the other       and shortly afterward i regained the partial use of my right       arm i now crawled with great caution toward parker without       getting on my legs and soon cut loose all the lashings about       him when after a short delay he also recovered the partial use       of his limbs we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from       peters it had cut a deep gash through the waistband of his       woollen pantaloons and through two shirts and made its way into       his groin from which the blood flowed out copiously as we       removed the cordage no sooner had we removed it however than       he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to       move with much greater ease than either parker or myselfthis was       no doubt owing to the discharge of blood        we had little hopes that augustus would recover as he evinced no       signs of life but upon getting to him we discovered that he       had merely swooned from the loss of blood the bandages we had       placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water       none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn       sufficiently tight to occasion his death having relieved him       from the fastenings and got him clear of the broken wood about       the windlass we secured him in a dry place to windward with his       head somewhat lower than his body and all three of us busied       ourselves in chafing his limbs in about half an hour he came to       himself although it was not until the next morning that he gave       signs of recognizing any of us or had sufficient strength to       speak by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was       quite dark and it began to cloud up so that we were again in       the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard in which       event nothing could have saved us from perishing exhausted as we       were by good fortune it continued very moderate during the       night the sea subsiding every minute which gave us great hopes       of ultimate preservation a gentle breeze still blew from the n       w but the weather was not at all cold augustus was lashed       carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from       slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel as he was still       too weak to hold on at all for ourselves there was no such       necessity we sat close together supporting each other with the       aid of the broken ropes about the windlass and devising methods       of escape from our frightful situation we derived much comfort       from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them       when we put them on after this they felt remarkably warm and       pleasant and served to invigorate us in no little degree we       helped augustus off with his and wrung them for him when he       experienced the same comfort        our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst and       when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect       our hearts sunk within us and we were induced to regret that we       had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea we endeavoured       however to console ourselves with the hope of being speedily       picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with       fortitude the evils that might happen        the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned and the weather       still continued clear and pleasant with a steady but very light       breeze from the n w the sea was now quite smooth and as from       some cause which we could not determine the brig did not lie so       much along as she had done before the deck was comparatively       dry and we could move about with freedom we had now been better       than three entire days and nights without either food or drink       and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt       to get up something from below as the brig was completely full       of water we went to this work despondently and with but little       expectation of being able to obtain anything we made a kind of       drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of       the companionhatch into two pieces of wood tying these across       each other and fastening them to the end of a rope we threw       them into the cabin and dragged them to and fro in the faint       hope of being thus able to entangle some article which might be       of use to us for food or which might at least render us       assistance in getting it we spent the greater part of the       morning in this labour without effect fishing up nothing more       than a few bedclothes which were readily caught by the nails       indeed our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater       success was hardly to be anticipated        we now tried the forecastle but equally in vain and were upon       the brink of despair when peters proposed that we should fasten       a rope to his body and let him make an attempt to get up       something by diving into the cabin this proposition we hailed       with all the delight which reviving hope could inspire he       proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception       of his pantaloons and a strong rope was then carefully fastened       around his middle being brought up over his shoulders in such a       manner that there was no possibility of its slipping the       undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger for as we       could hardly expect to find much if any provision in the cabin       itself it was necessary that the diver after letting himself       down should make a turn to the right and proceed under water a       distance of ten or twelve feet in a narrow passage to the       storeroom and return without drawing breath        everything being ready peters now descended in the cabin going       down the companionladder until the water reached his chin he       then plunged in head first turning to the right as he plunged       and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom in this first       attempt however he was altogether unsuccessful in less than       half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked       violently the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be       drawn up we accordingly drew him up instantly but so       incautiously as to bruise him badly against the ladder he had       brought nothing with him and had been unable to penetrate more       than a very little way into the passage owing to the constant       exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself       from floating up against the deck upon getting out he was very       much exhausted and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he       could again venture to descend        the second attempt met with even worse success for he remained       so long under water without giving the signal that becoming       alarmed for his safety we drew him out without it and found       that he was almost at the last gasp having as he said       repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it this was       probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the       balustrade at the foot of the ladder this balustrade was       indeed so much in the way that we determined to remove it if       possible before proceeding with our design as we had no means       of getting it away except by main force we all descended into       the water as far as we could on the ladder and giving a pull       against it with our united strength succeeded in breaking it       down        the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first       and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this       manner without the aid of some weight with which the diver might       steady himself and keep to the floor of the cabin while making       his search for a long time we looked about in vain for something       which might answer this purpose but at length to our great joy       we discovered one of the weatherforechains so loose that we had       not the least difficulty in wrenching it off having fastened       this securely to one of his ankles peters now made his fourth       descent into the cabin and this time succeeded in making his way       to the door of the stewards room to his inexpressible grief       however he found it locked and was obliged to return without       effecting an entrance as with the greatest exertion he could       remain under water not more at the utmost extent than a single       minute our affairs now looked gloomy indeed and neither       augustus nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears as we       thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us and the       slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape       but this weakness was not of long duration throwing ourselves on       our knees to god we implored his aid in the many dangers which       beset us and arose with renewed hope and vigor to think what       could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our       deliverance     chapter          shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look       upon as more intensely productive of emotion as far more replete       with the extremes first of delight and then of horror than even       any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine       long years crowded with events of the most startling and in       many cases of the most unconceived and unconceivable character       we were lying on the deck near the companionway and debating       the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom when       looking toward augustus who lay fronting myself i perceived       that he had become all at once deadly pale and that his lips       were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner       greatly alarmed i spoke to him but he made me no reply and i       was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill when i       took notice of his eyes which were glaring apparently at some       object behind me i turned my head and shall never forget the       ecstatic joy which thrilled through every particle of my frame       when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us and not more       than a couple of miles off i sprung to my feet as if a musket       bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart and stretching out       my arms in the direction of the vessel stood in this manner       motionless and unable to articulate a syllable peters and       parker were equally affected although in different ways the       former danced about the deck like a madman uttering the most       extravagant rhodomontades intermingled with howls and       imprecations while the latter burst into tears and continued       for many minutes weeping like a child        the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig of a dutch       build and painted black with a tawdry gilt figurehead she had       evidently seen a good deal of rough weather and we supposed       had suffered much in the gale which had proved so disastrous to       ourselves for her foretopmast was gone and some of her       starboard bulwarks when we first saw her she was as i have       already said about two miles off and to windward bearing down       upon us the breeze was very gentle and what astonished us       chiefly was that she had no other sails set than her foremast       and mainsail with a flying jibof course she came down but       slowly and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy the       awkward manner in which she steered too was remarked by all of       us even excited as we were she yawed about so considerably       that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us or       imagined that having seen us and discovered no person on board       she was about to tack and make off in another direction upon       each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our       voices when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her       intention and again hold on toward usthis singular conduct       being repeated two or three times so that at last we could think       of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the       helmsman to be in liquor        no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about       a quarter of a mile of us we then saw three seamen whom by       their dress we took to be hollanders two of these were lying on       some old sails near the forecastle and the third who appeared       to be looking at us with great curiosity was leaning over the       starboard bow near the bowsprit this last was a stout and tall       man with a very dark skin he seemed by his manner to be       encouraging us to have patience nodding to us in a cheerful       although rather odd way and smiling constantly so as to display       a set of the most brilliantly white teeth as his vessel drew       nearer we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his       head into the water but of this he took little or no notice       continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations i relate these       things and circumstances minutely and i relate them it must be       understood precisely as they appearedto us        the brig came on slowly and now more steadily than before andi       cannot speak calmly of this eventour hearts leaped up wildly       within us and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and       thanksgiving to god for the complete unexpected and glorious       deliverance that was so palpably at hand of a sudden and all at       once there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel       which was now close upon us a smell a stench such as the       whole world has no name forno conception ofhellishutterly       suffocatinginsufferable inconceivable i gasped for breath and       turning to my companions perceived that they were paler than       marble but we had now no time left for question or surmisethe       brig was within fifty feet of us and it seemed to be her       intention to run under our counter that we might board her       without putting out a boat we rushed aft when suddenly a wide       yaw threw her off full five or six points from the course she had       been running and as she passed under our stern at the distance       of about twenty feet we had a full view of her decks shall i       ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle twentyfive or       thirty human bodies among whom were several females lay       scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last       and most loathsome state of putrefaction we plainly saw that not       a soul lived in that fated vessel yet we could not help shouting       to the dead for help yes long and loudly did we beg in the       agony of the moment that those silent and disgusting images       would stay for us would not abandon us to become like them       would receive us among their goodly company we were raving with       horror and despairthoroughly mad through the anguish of our       grievous disappointment        as our first loud yell of terror broke forth it was replied to       by something from near the bowsprit of the stranger so closely       resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might       have been startled and deceived at this instant another sudden       yaw brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view       and we beheld at once the origin of the sound we saw the tall       stout figure still leaning on the bulwark and still nodding his       head to and fro but his face was now turned from us so that we       could not behold it his arms were extended over the rail and       the palms of his hands fell outward his knees were lodged upon a       stout rope tightly stretched and reaching from the heel of the       bowsprit to a cathead on his back from which a portion of the       shirt had been torn leaving it bare there sat a huge seagull       busily gorging itself with the horrible flesh its bill and       talons deep buried and its white plumage spattered all over with       blood as the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in       view the bird with much apparent difficulty drew out its       crimsoned head and after eyeing us for a moment as if       stupefied arose lazily from the body upon which it had been       feasting and flying directly above our deck hovered there a       while with a portion of clotted and liverlike substance in its       beak the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash       immediately at the feet of parker may god forgive me but now       for the first time there flashed through my mind a thought a       thought which i will not mention and i felt myself making a step       toward the ensanguined spot i looked upward and the eyes of       augustus met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning       which immediately brought me to my senses i sprang forward       quickly and with a deep shudder threw the frightful thing into       the sea        the body from which it had been taken resting as it did upon the       rope had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the       carnivorous bird and it was this motion which had at first       impressed us with the belief of its being alive as the gull       relieved it of its weight it swung round and fell partially       over so that the face was fully discovered never surely was       any object so terribly full of awe the eyes were gone and the       whole flesh around the mouth leaving the teeth utterly naked       this then was the smile which had cheered us on to hope this       thebut i forbear the brig as i have already told passed under       our stern and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward with       her and with her terrible crew went all our gay visions of       deliverance and joy deliberately as she went by we might       possibly have found means of boarding her had not our sudden       disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which       accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of       mind and body we had seen and felt but we could neither think       nor act until alas too late how much our intellects had been       weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact that when       the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more       than the half of her hull the proposition was seriously       entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming        i have since this period vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew       to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the       stranger her build and general appearance as i have before       stated led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader and the       dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion we might have       easily seen the name upon her stern and indeed taken other       observations which would have guided us in making out her       character but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to       every thing of that nature from the saffronlike hue of such of       the corpses as were not entirely decayed we concluded that the       whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever or some       other virulent disease of the same fearful kind if such were the       case and i know not what else to imagine death to judge from       the positions of the bodies must have come upon them in a manner       awfully sudden and overwhelming in a way totally distinct from       that which generally characterizes even the most deadly       pestilences with which mankind are acquainted it is possible       indeed that poison accidentally introduced into some of their       seastores may have brought about the disaster or that the       eating of some unknown venomous species of fish or other marine       animal or oceanic bird might have induced itbut it is utterly       useless to form conjectures where all is involved and will no       doubt remain for ever involved in the most appalling and       unfathomable mystery     chapter          we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid       lethargy gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness       hiding her from our sight recalled us in some measure to our       senses the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned absorbing       all other cares and considerations nothing however could be       done until the morning and securing ourselves as well as       possible we endeavoured to snatch a little repose in this i       succeeded beyond my expectations sleeping until my companions       who had not been so fortunate aroused me at daybreak to renew       our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull        it was now a dead calm with the sea as smooth as i have ever       known itthe weather warm and pleasant the brig was out of       sight we commenced our operations by wrenching off with some       trouble another of the forechains and having fastened both to       peters feet he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the       storeroom thinking it possible that he might be able to force it       open provided he could get at it in sufficient time and this he       hoped to do as the hulk lay much more steadily than before        he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door when loosening       one of the chains from his ankle he made every exertion to force       the passage with it but in vain the framework of the room being       far stronger than was anticipated he was quite exhausted with       his long stay under water and it became absolutely necessary       that some other one of us should take his place for this service       parker immediately volunteered but after making three       ineffectual efforts found that he could never even succeed in       getting near the door the condition of augustuss wounded arm       rendered it useless for him to attempt going down as he would be       unable to force the room open should he reach it and it       accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common       deliverance        peters had left one of the chains in the passage and i found       upon plunging in that i had not sufficient balance to keep me       firmly down i determined therefore to attempt no more in my       first effort than merely to recover the other chain in groping       along the floor of the passage for this i felt a hard substance       which i immediately grasped not having time to ascertain what it       was but returning and ascending instantly to the surface the       prize proved to be a bottle and our joy may be conceived when i       say that it was found to be full of port wine giving thanks to       god for this timely and cheering assistance we immediately drew       the cork with my penknife and each taking a moderate sup felt       the most indescribable comfort from the warmth strength and       spirits with which it inspired us we then carefully recorked the       bottle and by means of a handkerchief swung it in such a       manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken        having rested a while after this fortunate discovery i again       descended and now recovered the chain with which i instantly       came up i then fastened it on and went down for the third time       when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever in that       situation would enable me to force open the door of the       storeroom i therefore returned in despair        there seemed now to be no longer any room for hope and i could       perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made       up their minds to perish the wine had evidently produced in them       a species of delirium which perhaps i had been prevented from       feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it they       talked incoherently and about matters unconnected with our       condition peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket       augustus too i remember approached me with a serious air and       requested me to lend him a pocketcomb as his hair was full of       fishscales and he wished to get them out before going on shore       parker appeared somewhat less affected and urged me to dive at       random into the cabin and bring up any article which might come       to hand to this i consented and in the first attempt after       staying under a full minute brought up a small leather trunk       belonging to captain barnard this was immediately opened in the       faint hope that it might contain something to eat or drink we       found nothing however except a box of razors and two linen       shirts i now went down again and returned without any success       as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck and upon       getting up saw that my companions had ungratefully taken       advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine       having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before       i saw them i remonstrated with them on the heartlessness of       their conduct when augustus burst into tears the other two       endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke but i hope never       again to behold laughter of such a species the distortion of       countenance was absolutely frightful indeed it was apparent       that the stimulus in the empty state of their stomachs had       taken instant and violent effect and that they were all       exceedingly intoxicated with great difficulty i prevailed upon       them to lie down when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber       accompanied with loud stertorous breathing        i now found myself as it were alone in the brig and my       reflections to be sure were of the most fearful and gloomy       nature no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering       death by famine or at the best by being overwhelmed in the       first gale which should spring up for in our present exhausted       condition we could have no hope of living through another        the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly       insupportable and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths       in order to appease it with my knife i cut off a small portion       of the leather trunk and endeavoured to eat it but found it       utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel although i fancied       that some little alleviation of my suffering was obtained by       chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out toward night my       companions awoke one by one each in an indescribable state of       weakness and horror brought on by the wine whose fumes had now       evaporated they shook as if with a violent ague and uttered the       most lamentable cries for water their condition affected me in       the most lively degree at the same time causing me to rejoice in       the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from       indulging in the wine and consequently from sharing their       melancholy and most distressing sensations their conduct       however gave me great uneasiness and alarm for it was evident       that unless some favourable change took place they could afford       me no assistance in providing for our common safety i had not       yet abandoned all idea of being able to get up something from       below but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some       one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by       holding the end of the rope while i went down parker appeared to       be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others and       i endeavoured by every means in my power to rouse him thinking       that a plunge in the seawater might have a beneficial effect i       contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body and then       leading him to the companionway he remaining quite passive all       the while pushed him in and immediately drew him out i had       good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this       experiment for he appeared much revived and invigorated and       upon getting out asked me in a rational manner why i had so       served him having explained my object he expressed himself       indebted to me and said that he felt greatly better from the       immersion afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation we       then resolved to treat augustus and peters in the same way which       we immediately did when they both experienced much benefit from       the shock this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me       by reading in some medical work the good effect of the       showerbath in a case where the patient was suffering from mania       a potu        finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of       the rope i again made three or four plunges into the cabin       although it was now quite dark and a gentle but long swell from       the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady in the course       of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two caseknives a       threegallon jug empty and a blanket but nothing which could       serve us for food i continued my efforts after getting these       articles until i was completely exhausted but brought up       nothing else during the night parker and peters occupied       themselves by turns in the same manner but nothing coming to       hand we now gave up this attempt in despair concluding that we       were exhausting ourselves in vain        we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most       intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined       the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned and we looked       eagerly around the horizon for relief but to no purpose the sea       was still smooth with only a long swell from the northward as       on yesterday this was the sixth day since we had tasted either       food or drink with the exception of the bottle of port wine and       it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while       longer unless something could be obtained i never saw before       nor wish to see again human beings so utterly emaciated as       peters and augustus had i met them on shore in their present       condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i       had ever beheld them their countenances were totally changed in       character so that i could not bring myself to believe them       really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a       few days before parker although sadly reduced and so feeble       that he could not raise his head from his bosom was not so far       gone as the other two he suffered with great patience making no       complaint and endeavouring to inspire us with hope in every       manner he could devise for myself although at the commencement       of the voyage i had been in bad health and was at all times of a       delicate constitution i suffered less than any of us being much       less reduced in frame and retaining my powers of mind in a       surprising degree while the rest were completely prostrated in       intellect and seemed to be brought to a species of second       childhood generally simpering in their expressions with idiotic       smiles and uttering the most absurd platitudes at intervals       however they would appear to revive suddenly as if inspired all       at once with a consciousness of their condition when they would       spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour and speak       for a short period of their prospects in a manner altogether       rational although full of the most intense despair it is       possible however that my companions may have entertained the       same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine and that i       may have unwittingly been guilty of the same extravagances and       imbecilities as themselvesthis is a matter which cannot be       determined        about noon parker declared that he saw land off the larboard       quarter and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain       him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward       it peters and augustus took little notice of what he said being       apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation upon looking in the       direction pointed out i could not perceive the faintest       appearance of the shoreindeed i was too well aware that we were       far from any land to indulge in a hope of that nature it was a       long time nevertheless before i could convince parker of his       mistake he then burst into a flood of tears weeping like a       child with loud cries and sobs for two or three hours when       becoming exhausted he fell asleep        peters and augustus now made several ineffectual efforts to       swallow portions of the leather i advised them to chew it and       spit it out but they were too excessively debilitated to be able       to follow my advice i continued to chew pieces of it at       intervals and found some relief from so doing my chief distress       was for water and i was only prevented from taking a draught       from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus       have resulted to others who were similarly situated with       ourselves        the day wore on in this manner when i suddenly discovered a sail       to the eastward and on our larboard bow she appeared to be a       large ship and was coming nearly athwart us being probably       twelve or fifteen miles distant none of my companions had as yet       discovered her and i forbore to tell them of her for the       present lest we might again be disappointed of relief at length       upon her getting nearer i saw distinctly that she was heading       immediately for us with her light sails filled i could now       contain myself no longer and pointed her out to my       fellowsufferers they immediately sprang to their feet again       indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of joy weeping       laughing in an idiotic manner jumping stamping upon the deck       tearing their hair and praying and cursing by turns i was so       affected by their conduct as well as by what i considered a sure       prospect of deliverance that i could not refrain from joining in       with their madness and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude       and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck clapping my hands       shouting and other similar acts until i was suddenly called to       my recollection and once more to the extreme human misery and       despair by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully       presented toward us and steering in a direction nearly opposite       to that in which i had at first perceived her        it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to       believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken       place they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a       gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such       misrepresentations the conduct of augustus most sensibly       affected me in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary       he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us and       in making preparations to go on board of her some seaweed       floating by the brig he maintained that it was the ships boat       and endeavoured to throw himself upon it howling and shrieking       in the most heartrending manner when i forcibly restrained him       from thus casting himself into the sea        having become in some degree pacified we continued to watch the       ship until we finally lost sight of her the weather becoming       hazy with a light breeze springing up as soon as she was       entirely gone parker turned suddenly toward me with an       expression of countenance which made me shudder there was about       him an air of selfpossession which i had not noticed in him       until now and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he       would say he proposed in a few words that one of us should die       to preserve the existence of the others     chapter          i had for some time past dwelt upon the prospect of our being       reduced to this last horrible extremity and had secretly made up       my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances       rather than resort to such a course nor was this resolution in       any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under       which i laboured the proposition had not been heard by either       peters or augustus i therefore took parker aside and mentally       praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible       purpose he entertained i expostulated with him for a long time       and in the most supplicating manner begging him in the name of       every thing which he held sacred and urging him by every species       of argument which the extremity of the case suggested to abandon       the idea and not to mention it to either of the other two        he heard all i said without attempting to controvert any of my       arguments and i had begun to hope that he would be prevailed       upon to do as i desired but when i had ceased speaking he said       that he knew very well all i had said was true and that to       resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which       could enter into the mind of man but that he had now held out as       long as human nature could be sustained that it was unnecessary       for all to perish when by the death of one it was possible       and even probable that the rest might be finally preserved       adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him       from his purpose his mind having been thoroughly made up on the       subject even before the appearance of the ship and that only her       heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention       at an earlier period        i now begged him if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon       his design at least to defer it for another day when some       vessel might come to our relief again reiterating every argument       i could devise and which i thought likely to have influence with       one of his rough nature he said in reply that he had not       spoken until the very last possible moment that he could exist       no longer without sustenance of some kind and that therefore in       another day his suggestion would be too late as regarded himself       at least        finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a       mild tone i now assumed a different demeanor and told him that       he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our       calamities that my health and strength consequently were at       that moment far better than his own or than that either of       peters or augustus in short that i was in a condition to have       my own way by force if i found it necessary and that if he       attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody       and cannibal designs i would not hesitate to throw him into the       sea upon this he immediately seized me by the throat and       drawing a knife made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in       the stomach an atrocity which his excessive debility alone       prevented him from accomplishing in the meantime being roused       to a high pitch of anger i forced him to the vessels side with       the full intention of throwing him overboard he was saved from       his fate however by the interference of peters who now       approached and separated us asking the cause of the disturbance       this parker told before i could find means in any manner to       prevent him        the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had       anticipated both augustus and peters who it seems had long       secretly entertained the same fearful idea which parker had been       merely the first to broach joined with him in his design and       insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect i had       calculated that one at least of the two former would be found       still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with       myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose       and with the aid of either one of them i had no fear of being       able to prevent its accomplishment being disappointed in this       expectation it became absolutely necessary that i should attend       to my own safety as a further resistance on my part might       possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a       sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i       knew would speedily be enacted        i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal merely       requesting a delay of about one hour in order that the fog which       had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting when       it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in       sight after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to       wait thus long and as i had anticipated a breeze rapidly       coming in the fog lifted before the hour had expired when no       vessel appearing in sight we prepared to draw lots        it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling       scene which ensued a scene which with its minutest details no       after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree       from my memory and whose stern recollection will embitter every       future moment of my existence let me run over this portion of my       narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be       spoken of will permit the only method we could devise for the       terrific lottery in which we were to take each a chance was       that of drawing straws small splinters of wood were made to       answer our purpose and it was agreed that i should be the       holder i retired to one end of the hulk while my poor       companions silently took up their station in the other with their       backs turned toward me the bitterest anxiety which i endured at       any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in       the arrangement of the lots there are few conditions into which       man can possibly fall where he will not feel a deep interest in       the preservation of his existence an interest momentarily       increasing with the frailness of the tenure by which that       existence may be held but now that the silent definite and       stern nature of the business in which i was engaged so different       from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually       approaching horrors of famine allowed me to reflect on the few       chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deathsa death       for the most appalling of purposesevery particle of that energy       which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the       wind leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable       terror i could not at first even summon up sufficient strength       to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood my fingers       absolutely refusing their office and my knees knocking violently       against each other my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd       projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful       speculation i thought of falling on my knees to my companions       and entreating them to let me escape this necessity of suddenly       rushing upon them and by putting one of them to death of       rendering the decision by lot uselessin short of every thing       but of going through with the matter i had in hand at last       after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct i was       recalled to my senses by the voice of parker who urged me to       relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were       enduring even then i could not bring myself to arrange the       splinters upon the spot but thought over every species of       finesse by which i could trick some one of my fellowsufferers to       draw the short straw as it had been agreed that whoever drew the       shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the       preservation of the rest before any one condemn me for this       apparent heartlessness let him be placed in a situation       precisely similar to my own        at length delay was no longer possible and with a heart almost       bursting from my bosom i advanced to the region of the       forecastle where my companions were awaiting me i held out my       hand with the splinters and peters immediately drew he was       freehis at least was not the shortest and there was now       another chance against my escape i summoned up all my strength       and passed the lots to augustus he also drew immediately and he       also was free and now whether i should live or die the chances       were no more than precisely even at this moment all the       fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom and i felt toward my       poor fellowcreature parker the most intense the most       diabolical hatred but the feeling did not last and at length       with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes i held out the two       remaining splinters toward him it was fully five minutes before       he could summon resolution to draw during which period of       heartrending suspense i never once opened my eyes presently one       of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand the decision was       then over yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me no       one spoke and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the       splinter i held peters at length took me by the hand and i       forced myself to look up when i immediately saw by the       countenance of parker that i was safe and that he it was who had       been doomed to suffer gasping for breath i fell senseless to       the deck        i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of       the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental       in bringing it about he made no resistance whatever and was       stabbed in the back by peters when he fell instantly dead i       must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued       such things may be imagined but words have no power to impress       the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality let it       suffice to say that having in some measure appeased the raging       thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim and having       by common consent taken off the hands feet and head throwing       them together with the entrails into the sea we devoured the       rest of the body piecemeal during the four ever memorable days       of the seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth of the       month        on the nineteenth there coming on a smart shower which lasted       fifteen or twenty minutes we contrived to catch some water by       means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our       drag just after the gale the quantity we took in all did not       amount to more than half a gallon but even this scanty allowance       supplied us with comparative strength and hope        on the twentyfirst we were again reduced to the last necessity       the weather still remained warm and pleasant with occasional       fogs and light breezes most usually from n to w        on the twentysecond as we were sitting close huddled together       gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition there flashed       through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a       bright gleam of hope i remembered that when the foremast had       been cut away peters being in the windward chains passed one       of the axes into my hand requesting me to put it if possible       in a place of security and that a few minutes before the last       heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe       into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths i       now thought it possible that by getting at this axe we might       cut through the deck over the storeroom and thus readily supply       ourselves with provisions        when i communicated this object to my companions they uttered a       feeble shout of joy and we all proceeded forthwith to the       forecastle the difficulty of descending here was greater than       that of going down in the cabin the opening being much smaller       for it will be remembered that the whole framework about the       cabin companionhatch had been carried away whereas the       forecastleway being a simple hatch of only about three feet       square had remained uninjured i did not hesitate however to       attempt the descent and a rope being fastened round my body as       before i plunged boldly in feet foremost made my way quickly       to the berth and at the first attempt brought up the axe it was       hailed with the most ecstatic joy and triumph and the ease with       which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our       ultimate preservation        we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of       rekindled hope peters and myself taking the axe by turns       augustuss wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any       degree as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to       stand unsupported and could consequently work but a minute or       two without resting it soon became evident that many long hours       would be necessary to accomplish our taskthat is to cut an       opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the       storeroom this consideration however did not discourage us       and working all night by the light of the moon we succeeded in       effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the       twentythird        peters now volunteered to go down and having made all       arrangements as before he descended and soon returned bringing       up with him a small jar which to our great joy proved to be       full of olives having shared these among us and devoured them       with the greatest avidity we proceeded to let him down again       this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations returning       instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine of the       latter we each took a moderate sup having learned by experience       the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely the ham       except about two pounds near the bone was not in a condition to       be eaten having been entirely spoiled by the salt water the       sound part was divided among us peters and augustus not being       able to restrain their appetite swallowed theirs upon the       instant but i was more cautious and ate but a small portion of       mine dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue we now rested       a while from our labors which had been intolerably severe        by noon feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed we again       renewed our attempt at getting up provisions peters and myself       going down alternately and always with more or less success       until sundown during this interval we had the good fortune to       bring up altogether four more small jars of olives another       ham a carboy containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape       madeira wine and what gave us still more delight a small       tortoise of the gallipago breed several of which had been taken       on board by captain barnard as the grampus was leaving port       from the schooner mary pitts just returned from a sealing       voyage in the pacific        in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent       occasion to mention this species of tortoise it is found       principally as most of my readers may know in the group of       islands called the gallipagos which indeed derive their name       from the animalthe spanish word gallipago meaning a freshwater       terrapin from the peculiarity of their shape and action they       have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise they are       frequently found of an enormous size i have myself seen several       which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds although       i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them       weighing more than eight hundred their appearance is singular       and even disgusting their steps are very slow measured and       heavy their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground       their neck is long and exceedingly slender from eighteen inches       to two feet is a very common length and i killed one where the       distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no       less than three feet ten inches the head has a striking       resemblance to that of a serpent they can exist without food for       an almost incredible length of time instances having been known       where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain       two years without nourishment of any kindbeing as fat and in       every respect in as good order at the expiration of the time as       when they were first put in in one particular these       extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary or       camel of the desert in a bag at the root of the neck they carry       with them a constant supply of water in some instances upon       killing them after a full years deprivation of all nourishment       as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have       been found in their bags their food is chiefly wild parsley and       celery with purslain seakelp and prickly pears upon which       latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully a great quantity of it       being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the       animal itself is discovered they are excellent and highly       nutritious food and have no doubt been the means of preserving       the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the whalefishery       and other pursuits in the pacific        the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the       storeroom was not of a large size weighing probably sixtyfive       or seventy pounds it was a female and in excellent condition       being exceedingly fat and having more than a quart of limpid and       sweet water in its bag this was indeed a treasure and falling       on our knees with one accord we returned fervent thanks to god       for so seasonable a relief        we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the       opening as its struggles were fierce and its strength       prodigious it was upon the point of making its escape from       peters grasp and slipping back into the water when augustus       throwing a rope with a slipknot around its throat held it up in       this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters       and assisted him in lifting it out        the water we drew carefully from the bag into the jug which it       will be remembered had been brought up before from the cabin       having done this we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to       form with the cork a kind of glass holding not quite half a       gill we then each drank one of these measures full and resolved       to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should       hold out        during the last two or three days the weather having been dry       and pleasant the bedding we had obtained from the cabin as well       as our clothing had become thoroughly dry so that we passed       this night that of the twentythird in comparative comfort       enjoying a tranquil repose after having supped plentifully on       olives and ham with a small allowance of the wine being afraid       of losing some of our stores overboard during the night in the       event of a breeze springing up we secured them as well as       possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass our       tortoise which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we       could we threw on its back and otherwise carefully fastened     chapter          july  this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and       strength notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were       still placed ignorant of our position although certainly at a       great distance from land without more food than would last us       for a fortnight even with great care almost entirely without       water and floating about at the mercy of every wind and wave on       the merest wreck in the world still the infinitely more terrible       distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so       providentially been delivered caused us to regard what we now       endured as but little more than an ordinary evilso strictly       comparative is either good or ill        at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up       something from the storeroom when a smart shower coming on       with some lightning we turn our attention to the catching of       water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose       we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the       sheet spread out with one of the forechainplates in the middle       of it the water thus conducted to the centre was drained       through into our jug we had nearly filled it in this manner       when a heavy squall coming on from the northward obliged us to       desist as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we       could no longer keep our feet we now went forward and lashing       ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before       awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been       anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the       circumstances at noon the wind had freshened into a tworeef       breeze and by night into a stiff gale accompanied with a       tremendously heavy swell experience having taught us however       the best method of arranging our lashings we weathered this       dreary night in tolerable security although thoroughly drenched       at almost every instant by the sea and in momentary dread of       being washed off fortunately the weather was so warm as to       render the water rather grateful than otherwise        july  this morning the gale had diminished to a mere tenknot       breeze and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we       were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck to our great       grief however we found that two jars of our olives as well as       the whole of our ham had been washed overboard in spite of the       careful manner in which they had been fastened we determined not       to kill the tortoise as yet and contented ourselves for the       present with a breakfast on a few of the olives and a measure of       water each which latter we mixed half and half with wine       finding great relief and strength from the mixture without the       distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port       the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at       getting up provision from the storeroom several articles of no       importance to us in our present situation floated up through the       opening during the day and were immediately washed overboard we       also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever so that       we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves on this       account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day at noon the sun       appeared to be nearly vertical and we had no doubt that we had       been driven down by the long succession of northward and       northwesterly winds into the near vicinity of the equator toward       evening we saw several sharks and were somewhat alarmed by the       audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us       at one time a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the       water the monster actually swam in upon us floundering for some       moments just over the companionhatch and striking peters       violently with his tail a heavy sea at length hurled him       overboard much to our relief in moderate weather we might have       easily captured him        july  this morning the wind having greatly abated and the       sea not being very rough we determined to renew our exertions in       the storeroom after a great deal of hard labor during the whole       day we found that nothing further was to be expected from this       quarter the partitions of the room having been stove during the       night and its contents swept into the hold this discovery as       may be supposed filled us with despair        july  the sea nearly smooth with a light wind and still from       the northward and westward the sun coming out hotly in the       afternoon we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes found       great relief from thirst and much comfort otherwise by bathing       in the sea in this however we were forced to use great       caution being afraid of sharks several of which were seen       swimming around the brig during the day        july  good weather still the brig now began to lie along so       alarmingly that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up       prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency       lashing our tortoise waterjug and two remaining jars of olives       as far as possible over to the windward placing them outside the       hull below the mainchains the sea very smooth all day with       little or no wind        july  a continuance of the same weather augustuss wounded       arm began to evince symptoms of mortification he complained of       drowsiness and excessive thirst but no acute pain nothing could       be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of       the vinegar from the olives and from this no benefit seemed to       be experienced we did every thing in our power for his comfort       and trebled his allowance of water        july  an excessively hot day with no wind an enormous shark       kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon we made       several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose       augustus much worse and evidently sinking as much from want of       proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds he       constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings wishing for       nothing but death this evening we ate the last of our olives       and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not       swallow it at all without the addition of wine determined to       kill our tortoise in the morning        july  after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue owing to       the position of the hulk we set about killing and cutting up our       tortoise he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed       although in good conditionthe whole meat about him not       amounting to more than ten pounds with a view of preserving a       portion of this as long as possible we cut it into fine pieces       and filled with them our three remaining olive jars and the       winebottle all of which had been kept pouring in afterward       the vinegar from the olives in this manner we put away about       three pounds of the tortoise intending not to touch it until we       had consumed the rest we concluded to restrict ourselves to       about four ounces of the meat per day the whole would thus last       us thirteen days a brisk shower with severe thunder and       lightning came on about dusk but lasted so short a time that we       only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water the whole       of this by common consent was given to augustus who now       appeared to be in the last extremity he drank the water from the       sheet as we caught it we holding it above him as he lay so as to       let it run into his mouth for we had now nothing left capable       of holding water unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from       the carboy or the stale water from the jug either of these       expedients would have been resorted to had the shower lasted        the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the       draught his arm was completely black from the wrist to the       shoulder and his feet were like ice we expected every moment to       see him breathe his last he was frightfully emaciated so much       so that although he weighed a hundred and twentyseven pounds       upon his leaving nantucket he now did not weigh more than forty       or fifty at the farthest his eyes were sunk far in his head       being scarcely perceptible and the skin of his cheeks hung so       loosely as to prevent his masticating any food or even       swallowing any liquid without great difficulty        august  a continuance of the same calm weather with an       oppressively hot sun suffered exceedingly from thirst the water       in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin we       contrived nevertheless to swallow a portion of it by mixing it       with wine our thirst however was but little abated we found       more relief by bathing in the sea but could not avail ourselves       of this expedient except at long intervals on account of the       continual presence of sharks we now saw clearly that augustus       could not be saved that he was evidently dying we could do       nothing to relieve his sufferings which appeared to be great       about twelve oclock he expired in strong convulsions and       without having spoken for several hours his death filled us with       the most gloomy forebodings and had so great an effect upon our       spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole       day and never addressed each other except in a whisper it was       not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and       throw the body overboard it was then loathsome beyond       expression and so far decayed that as peters attempted to lift       it an entire leg came off in his grasp as the mass of       putrefaction slipped over the vessels side into the water the       glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly       discovered to us seven or eight large sharks the clashing of       whose horrible teeth as their prey was torn to pieces among       them might have been heard at the distance of a mile we shrunk       within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound        august  the same fearfully calm and hot weather the dawn found       us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion       the water in the jug was now absolutely useless being a thick       gelatinous mass nothing but frightfullooking worms mingled with       slime we threw it out and washed the jug well in the sea       afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of       pickled tortoise our thirst could now scarcely be endured and       we tried in vain to relieve it by wine which seemed only to add       fuel to the flame and excited us to a high degree of       intoxication we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings       by mixing the wine with seawater but this instantly brought       about the most violent retchings so that we never again       attempted it during the whole day we anxiously sought an       opportunity of bathing but to no purpose for the hulk was now       entirely besieged on all sides with sharksno doubt the identical       monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening       before and who were in momentary expectation of another similar       feast this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and       filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings we       had experienced indescribable relief in bathing and to have this       resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could       bear nor indeed were we altogether free from the apprehension       of immediate danger for the least slip or false movement would       have thrown us at once within reach of those voracious fish who       frequently thrust themselves directly upon us swimming up to       leeward no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them       even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters and       much wounded he persisted in his attempts to push in where we       were a cloud came up at dusk but to our extreme anguish       passed over without discharging itself it is quite impossible to       conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period we passed a       sleepless night both on this account and through dread of the       sharks        august  no prospect of relief and the brig lying still more       and more along so that now we could not maintain a footing upon       deck at all busied ourselves in securing our wine and       tortoisemeat so that we might not lose them in the event of our       rolling over got out two stout spikes from the forechains and       by means of the axe drove them into the hull to windward within       a couple of feet of the water this not being very far from the       keel as we were nearly upon our beamends to these spikes we       now lashed our provisions as being more secure than their former       position beneath the chains suffered great agony from thirst       during the whole dayno chance of bathing on account of the       sharks which never left us for a moment found it impossible to       sleep        august  a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was       heeling over and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off       by the movement at first the roll was slow and gradual and we       contrived to clamber over to windward very well having taken the       precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven       in for the provision but we had not calculated sufficiently upon       the acceleration of the impetus for presently the heel became       too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it and before       either of us knew what was to happen we found ourselves hurled       furiously into the sea and struggling several fathoms beneath       the surface with the huge hull immediately above us        in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold       upon the rope and finding that i was completely beneath the       vessel and my strength nearly exhausted i scarcely made a       struggle for life and resigned myself in a few seconds to die       but here again i was deceived not having taken into       consideration the natural rebound of the hull to windward the       whirl of the water upward which the vessel occasioned in rolling       partially back brought me to the surface still more violently       than i had been plunged beneath upon coming up i found myself       about twenty yards from the hulk as near as i could judge she       was lying keel up rocking furiously from side to side and the       sea in all directions around was much agitated and full of       strong whirlpools i could see nothing of peters an oilcask was       floating within a few feet of me and various other articles from       the brig were scattered about        my principal terror was now on account of the sharks which i       knew to be in my vicinity in order to deter these if possible       from approaching me i splashed the water vigorously with both       hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk creating a body of       foam i have no doubt that to this expedient simple as it was i       was indebted for my preservation for the sea all round the brig       just before her rolling over was so crowded with these monsters       that i must have been and really was in actual contact with       some of them during my progress by great good fortune however       i reached the side of the vessel in safety although so utterly       weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never       have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of       peters who now to my great joy made his appearance having       scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull and       threw me the end of a ropeone of those which had been attached       to the spikes        having barely escaped this danger our attention was now directed       to the dreadful imminency of anotherthat of absolute starvation       our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of       all our care in securing it and seeing no longer the remotest       possibility of obtaining more we gave way both of us to despair       weeping aloud like children and neither of us attempting to       offer consolation to the other such weakness can scarcely be       conceived and to those who have never been similarly situated       will no doubt appear unnatural but it must be remembered that       our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of       privation and terror to which we had been subjected that we       could not justly be considered at that period in the light of       rational beings in subsequent perils nearly as great if not       greater i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my       situation and peters it will be seen evinced a stoical       philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike       supineness and imbecilitythe mental condition made the       difference        the overturning of the brig even with the consequent loss of the       wine and turtle would not in fact have rendered our situation       more deplorable than before except for the disappearance of the       bedclothes by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch       rainwater and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught       for we found the whole bottom from within two or three feet of       the bends as far as the keel together with the keel itself       thickly covered with large barnacles which proved to be       excellent and highly nutritious food thus in two important       respects the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a       benefit rather than an injury it had opened to us a supply of       provisions which we could not have exhausted using it       moderately in a month and it had greatly contributed to our       comfort as regards position we being much more at ease and in       infinitely less danger than before        the difficulty however of now obtaining water blinded us to all       the benefits of the change in our condition that we might be       ready to avail ourselves as far as possible of any shower which       might fall we took off our shirts to make use of them as we had       of the sheetsnot hoping of course to get more in this way       even under the most favorable circumstances than half a gill at       a time no signs of a cloud appeared during the day and the       agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable at night peters       obtained about an hours disturbed sleep but my intense       sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single       moment        august  today a gentle breeze springing up carried us through       a vast quantity of seaweed among which we were so fortunate as       to find eleven small crabs which afforded us several delicious       meals their shells being quite soft we ate them entire and       found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles       seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed we also ventured to       bathe and remained in the water for four or five hours during       which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst       were greatly refreshed and spent the night somewhat more       comfortably than before both of us snatching a little sleep        august  this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain       lasting from about noon until after dark bitterly did we now       regret the loss of our jug and carboy for in spite of the       little means we had of catching the water we might have filled       one if not both of them as it was we contrived to satisfy the       cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated       and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle       into our mouths in this occupation we passed the entire day        august  just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a       sail to the eastward and evidently coming towards us we       hailed the glorious sight with a long although feeble shout of       rapture and began instantly to make every signal in our power       by flaring the shirts in the air leaping as high as our weak       condition would permit and even by hallooing with all the       strength of our lungs although the vessel could not have been       less than fifteen miles distant however she still continued to       near our hulk and we felt that if she but held her present       course she must eventually come so close as to perceive us in       about an hour after we first discovered her we could clearly see       the people on her decks she was a long low and rakishlooking       topsail schooner with a black ball in her foretopsail and had       apparently a full crew we now became alarmed for we could       hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us and were       apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we werean       act of fiendish barbarity which however incredible it may       appear has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea under       circumstances very nearly similar and by beings who were       regarded as belonging to the human species  in this       instance however by the mercy of god we were destined to be       most happily deceived for presently we were aware of a sudden       commotion on the deck of the stranger who immediately afterward       ran up a british flag and hauling her wind bore up directly       upon us in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin       she proved to be the jane guy of liverpool captain guy bound       on a sealing and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific     chapter          the jane guy was a finelooking topsail schooner of a hundred       and eighty tons burden she was unusually sharp in the bows and       on a wind in moderate weather the fastest sailer i have ever       seen her qualities however as a rough seaboat were not so       good and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade       to which she was destined for this peculiar service a larger       vessel and one of a light proportionate draught is       desirablesay a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and       fifty tons she should be barkrigged and in other respects of a       different construction from the usual south sea ships it is       absolutely necessary that she should be well armed she should       have say ten or twelve twelvepound carronades and two or three       long twelves with brass blunderbusses and watertight       armchests for each top her anchors and cables should be of far       greater strength than is required for any other species of trade       and above all her crew should be numerous and efficientnot       less for such a vessel as i have described than fifty or sixty       ablebodied men the jane guy had a crew of thirtyfive all able       seamen besides the captain and mate but she was not altogether       as well armed or otherwise equipped as a navigator acquainted       with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have       desired        captain guy was a gentleman of great urbanity of manner and of       considerable experience in the southern traffic to which he had       devoted a great portion of his life he was deficient however       in energy and consequently in that spirit of enterprise which       is here so absolutely requisite he was part owner of the vessel       in which he sailed and was invested with discretionary powers to       cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most       readily to hand he had on board as usual in such voyages       beads lookingglasses tinderworks axes hatchets saws       adzes planes chisels gouges gimlets files spokeshaves       rasps hammers nails knives scissors razors needles thread       crockeryware calico trinkets and other similar articles        the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july crossed       the tropic of cancer on the twentyfifth in longitude twenty       degrees west and reached sal one of the cape verd islands on       the twentyninth where she took in salt and other necessaries       for the voyage on the third of august she left the cape verds       and steered southwest stretching over toward the coast of       brazil so as to cross the equator between the meridians of       twentyeight and thirty degrees west longitude this is the       course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of       good hope or by that route to the east indies by proceeding       thus they avoid the calms and strong contrary currents which       continually prevail on the coast of guinea while in the end it       is found to be the shortest track as westerly winds are never       wanting afterward by which to reach the cape it was captain       guys intention to make his first stoppage at kerguelens landi       hardly know for what reason on the day we were picked up the       schooner was off cape st roque in longitude thirtyone degrees       west so that when found we had drifted probably from north to       south not less than fiveandtwenty degrees        on board the jane guy we were treated with all the kindness our       distressed situation demanded in about a fortnight during which       time we continued steering to the southeast with gentle breezes       and fine weather both peters and myself recovered entirely from       the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings and we       began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream       from which we had been happily awakened than as events which had       taken place in sober and naked reality i have since found that       this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by       sudden transition whether from joy to sorrow or from sorrow to       joythe degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree       of difference in the exchange thus in my own case i now feel       it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i       endured during the days spent upon the hulk the incidents are       remembered but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at       the time of their occurrence i only know that when they did       occur i then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of       agony        we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of       greater moment than the occasional meeting with whalingships       and more frequently with the black or right whale so called in       contradistinction to the spermaceti these however were chiefly       found south of the twentyfifth parallel on the sixteenth of       september being in the vicinity of the cape of good hope the       schooner encountered her first gale of any violence since leaving       liverpool in this neighborhood but more frequently to the south       and east of the promontory we were to the westward navigators       have often to contend with storms from the northward which rage       with great fury they always bring with them a heavy sea and one       of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping       round of the wind an occurrence almost certain to take place       during the greatest force of the gale a perfect hurricane will       be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast and in       the next not a breath of wind will be felt in that direction       while from the southwest it will come out all at once with a       violence almost inconceivable a bright spot to the southward is       the sure forerunner of the change and vessels are thus enabled       to take the proper precautions        it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a       white squall and as usual from the northward by eight it had       increased very much and brought down upon us one of the most       tremendous seas i had then ever beheld every thing had been made       as snug as possible but the schooner laboured excessively and       gave evidence of her bad qualities as a seaboat pitching her       forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty       struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another       just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the       lookout made its appearance in the southwest and in an hour       afterward we perceived the little headsail we carried flapping       listlessly against the mast in two minutes more in spite of       every preparation we were hurled on our beamends as if by       magic and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over       us as we lay the blow from the southwest however luckily       proved to be nothing more than a squall and we had the good       fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar a heavy       cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this but       toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as       before the gale captain guy considered that he had made an       escape little less than miraculous        on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of prince edwards       island in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees        e two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island       and presently passed the islands of crozet in latitude        degrees  s longitude  degrees e on the eighteenth we made       kerguelens or desolation island in the southern indian ocean       and came to anchor in christmas harbour having four fathoms of       water        this island or rather group of islands bears southeast from the       cape of good hope and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred       leagues it was first discovered in  by the baron de       kergulen or kerguelen a frenchman who thinking the land to       form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home       information to that effect which produced much excitement at the       time the government taking the matter up sent the baron back       in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery       a critical examination when the mistake was discovered in        captain cook fell in with the same group and gave to the       principal one the name of desolation island a title which it       certainly well deserves upon approaching the land however the       navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise as the sides of       most of the hills from september to march are clothed with very       brilliant verdure this deceitful appearance is caused by a small       plant resembling saxifrage which is abundant growing in large       patches on a species of crumbling moss besides this plant there       is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island if we except some       coarse rank grass near the harbor some lichen and a shrub which       bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed and which has       a bitter and acrid taste        the face of the country is hilly although none of the hills can       be called lofty their tops are perpetually covered with snow       there are several harbors of which christmas harbour is the most       convenient it is the first to be met with on the northeast side       of the island after passing cape francois which forms the       northern shore and by its peculiar shape serves to distinguish       the harbour its projecting point terminates in a high rock       through which is a large hole forming a natural arch the       entrance is in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees        e passing in here good anchorage may be found under the       shelter of several small islands which form a sufficient       protection from all easterly winds proceeding on eastwardly from       this anchorage you come to wasp bay at the head of the harbour       this is a small basin completely landlocked into which you can       go with four fathoms and find anchorage in from ten to three       hard clay bottom a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead       all the year round without risk to the westward at the head of       wasp bay is a small stream of excellent water easily procured        some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on       kerguelens island and sea elephants abound the feathered       tribes are discovered in great numbers penguins are very plenty       and of these there are four different kinds the royal penguin       so called from its size and beautiful plumage is the largest       the upper part of the body is usually gray sometimes of a lilac       tint the under portion of the purest white imaginable the head       is of a glossy and most brilliant black the feet also the chief       beauty of plumage however consists in two broad stripes of a       gold color which pass along from the head to the breast the       bill is long and either pink or bright scarlet these birds walk       erect with a stately carriage they carry their heads high with       their wings drooping like two arms and as their tails project       from their body in a line with the legs the resemblance to a       human figure is very striking and would be apt to deceive the       spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening the       royal penguins which we met with on kerguelens land were rather       larger than a goose the other kinds are the macaroni the       jackass and the rookery penguin these are much smaller less       beautiful in plumage and different in other respects        besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found among       which may be mentioned seahens blue peterels teal ducks port       egmont hens shags cape pigeons the nelly sea swallows terns       sea gulls mother careys chickens mother careys geese or the       great peterel and lastly the albatross        the great peterel is as large as the common albatross and is       carnivorous it is frequently called the breakbones or osprey       peterel they are not at all shy and when properly cooked are       palatable food in flying they sometimes sail very close to the       surface of the water with the wings expanded without appearing       to move them in the least degree or make any exertion with them       whatever        the albatross is one of the largest and fiercest of the south sea       birds it is of the gull species and takes its prey on the wing       never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding between       this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists       their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan       concerted between the two speciesthat of the albatross being       placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of       four penguins navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of       such encampments a rookery these rookeries have been often       described but as my readers may not all have seen these       descriptions and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of       the penguin and albatross it will not be amiss to say something       here of their mode of building and living        when the season for incubation arrives the birds assemble in       vast numbers and for some days appear to be deliberating upon       the proper course to be pursued at length they proceed to       action a level piece of ground is selected of suitable extent       usually comprising three or four acres and situated as near the       sea as possible being still beyond its reach the spot is chosen       with reference to its evenness of surface and that is preferred       which is the least encumbered with stones this matter being       arranged the birds proceed with one accord and actuated       apparently by one mind to trace out with mathematical accuracy       either a square or other parallelogram as may best suit the       nature of the ground and of just sufficient size to accommodate       easily all the birds assembled and no morein this particular       seeming determined upon preventing the access of future       stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the       encampment one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel       with the waters edge and is left open for ingress or egress        having defined the limits of the rookery the colony now begin to       clear it of every species of rubbish picking up stone by stone       and carrying them outside of the lines and close by them so as       to form a wall on the three inland sides just within this wall a       perfectly level and smooth walk is formed from six to eight feet       wide and extending around the encampmentthus serving the       purpose of a general promenade        the next process is to partition out the whole area into small       squares exactly equal in size this is done by forming narrow       paths very smooth and crossing each other at right angles       throughout the entire extent of the rookery at each intersection       of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed and a       penguins nest in the centre of each squarethus every penguin is       surrounded by four albatrosses and each albatross by a like       number of penguins the penguins nest consists of a hole in the       earth very shallow being only just of sufficient depth to keep       her single egg from rolling the albatross is somewhat less       simple in her arrangements erecting a hillock about a foot high       and two in diameter this is made of earth seaweed and shells       on its summit she builds her nest        the birds take especial care never to leave their nests       unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation or       indeed until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take       care of themselves while the male is absent at sea in search of       food the female remains on duty and it is only upon the return       of her partner that she ventures abroad the eggs are never left       uncovered at allwhile one bird leaves the nest the other       nestling in by its side this precaution is rendered necessary by       the thieving propensities prevalent in the rookery the       inhabitants making no scruple to purloin each others eggs at       every good opportunity        although there are some rookeries in which the penguin and       albatross are the sole population yet in most of them a variety       of oceanic birds are to be met with enjoying all the privileges       of citizenship and scattering their nests here and there       wherever they can find room never interfering however with the       stations of the larger species the appearance of such       encampments when seen from a distance is exceedingly singular       the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with       the immense number of the albatross mingled with the smaller       tribes which are continually hovering over it either going to       the ocean or returning home at the same time a crowd of penguins       are to be observed some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys       and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them       around the general promenade ground which encircles the rookery       in short survey it as we will nothing can be more astonishing       than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings       and nothing surely can be better calculated to elicit reflection       in every wellregulated human intellect        on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief       mate mr patterson took the boats and although it was       somewhat early in the season went in search of seal leaving the       captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to       the westward they having some business whose nature i could not       ascertain to transact in the interior of the island captain guy       took with him a bottle in which was a sealed letter and made       his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of       the highest peaks in the place it is probable that his design       was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he       expected to come after him as soon as we lost sight of him we       proceeded peters and myself being in the mates boat on our       cruise around the coast looking for seal in this business we       were occupied about three weeks examining with great care every       nook and corner not only of kerguelens land but of the several       small islands in the vicinity our labours however were not       crowned with any important success we saw a great many fur seal       but they were exceedingly shy and with the greatest exertions       we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all sea       elephants were abundant especially on the western coast of the       mainland but of these we killed only twenty and this with great       difficulty on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of       the hair seal but did not molest them we returned to the       schooner on the eleventh where we found captain guy and his       nephew who gave a very bad account of the interior representing       it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the       world they had remained two nights on the island owing to some       misunderstanding on the part of the second mate in regard to       the sending a jollyboat from the schooner to take them off     chapter          on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour retracing our       way to the westward and leaving marions island one of crozets       group on the larboard we afterward passed prince edwards       island leaving it also on our left then steering more to the       northward made in fifteen days the islands of tristan       dacunha in latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees  w        this group now so well known and which consists of three       circular islands was first discovered by the portuguese and was       visited afterward by the dutch in  and by the french in        the three islands together form a triangle and are distant       from each other about ten miles there being fine open passages       between the land in all of them is very high especially in       tristan dacunha properly so called this is the largest of the       group being fifteen miles in circumference and so elevated that       it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or       ninety miles a part of the land toward the north rises more than       a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea a tableland at this       height extends back nearly to the centre of the island and from       this tableland arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe the       lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size but       the upper region is barren rock usually hidden among the clouds       and covered with snow during the greater part of the year there       are no shoals or other dangers about the island the shores being       remarkably bold and the water deep on the northwestern coast is       a bay with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can       be easily effected provided there be a southerly wind plenty of       excellent water may here be readily procured also cod and other       fish may be taken with hook and line        the next island in point of size and the most westwardly of the       group is that called the inaccessible its precise situation is        degrees  s latitude longitude  degrees  w it is       seven or eight miles in circumference and on all sides presents       a forbidding and precipitous aspect its top is perfectly flat       and the whole region is sterile nothing growing upon it except a       few stunted shrubs        nightingale island the smallest and most southerly is in       latitude  degrees  s longitude  degrees  w off its       southern extremity is a high ledge of rocky islets a few also of       a similar appearance are seen to the northeast the ground is       irregular and sterile and a deep valley partially separates it        the shores of these islands abound in the proper season with       sea lions sea elephants the hair and fur seal together with a       great variety of oceanic birds whales are also plenty in their       vicinity owing to the ease with which these various animals were       here formerly taken the group has been much visited since its       discovery the dutch and french frequented it at a very early       period in  captain patten of the ship industry of       philadelphia made tristan dacunha where he remained seven       months from august  to april  for the purpose of       collecting sealskins in this time he gathered no less than five       thousand six hundred and says that he would have had no       difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks upon       his arrival he found no quadrupeds with the exception of a few       wild goats the island now abounds with all our most valuable       domestic animals which have been introduced by subsequent       navigators        i believe it was not long after captain pattens visit that       captain colquhoun of the american brig betsey touched at the       largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment he planted       onions potatoes cabbages and a great many other vegetables an       abundance of all which is now to be met with        in  a captain haywood in the nereus visited tristan he       found there three americans who were residing upon the island to       prepare sealskins and oil one of these men was named jonathan       lambert and he called himself the sovereign of the country he       had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land and turned       his attention to raising the coffeeplant and sugarcane with       which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio       janeiro this settlement however was finally abandoned and in        the islands were taken possession of by the british       government who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape       of good hope they did not however retain them long but upon       the evacuation of the country as a british possession two or       three english families took up their residence there       independently of the government on the twentyfifth of march        the berwick captain jeffrey from london to van diemens       land arrived at the place where they found an englishman of the       name of glass formerly a corporal in the british artillery he       claimed to be supreme governor of the islands and had under his       control twentyone men and three women he gave a very favourable       account of the salubrity of the climate and of the productiveness       of the soil the population occupied themselves chiefly in       collecting sealskins and sea elephant oil with which they traded       to the cape of good hope glass owning a small schooner at the       period of our arrival the governor was still a resident but his       little community had multiplied there being fiftysix persons       upon tristan besides a smaller settlement of seven on       nightingale island we had no difficulty in procuring almost       every kind of refreshment which we requiredsheep hogs       bullocks rabbits poultry goats fish in great variety and       vegetables were abundant having come to anchor close in with the       large island in eighteen fathoms we took all we wanted on board       very conveniently captain guy also purchased of glass five       hundred sealskins and some ivory we remained here a week during       which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward       and the weather somewhat hazy on the fifth of november we made       sail to the southward and westward with the intention of having       a thorough search for a group of islands called the auroras       respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has       existed        these islands are said to have been discovered as early as        by the commander of the ship aurora in  captain manuel de       oyarvido in the ship princess belonging to the royal philippine       company sailed as he asserts directly among them in  the       spanish corvette atrevida went with the determination of       ascertaining their precise situation and in a paper published       by the royal hydrographical society of madrid in the year        the following language is used respecting this expedition the       corvette atrevida practised in their immediate vicinity from       the twentyfirst to the twentyseventh of january all the       necessary observations and measured by chronometers the       difference of longitude between these islands and the port of       soledad in the manillas the islands are three they are very       nearly in the same meridian the centre one is rather low and       the other two may be seen at nine leagues distance the       observations made on board the atrevida give the following       results as the precise situation of each island the most       northern is in latitude  degrees   s longitude        degrees   w the middle one in latitude  degrees         s longitude  degrees   w and the most southern in       latitude  degrees   s longitude  degrees   w        on the twentyseventh of january  captain james weddel of       the british navy sailed from staten land also in search of the       auroras he reports that having made the most diligent search       and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the       commander of the atrevida but in every direction throughout the       vicinity of these spots he could discover no indication of land       these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to       look out for the islands and strange to say while some have       sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie       without finding them there have been not a few who declare       positively that they have seen them and even been close in with       their shores it was captain guys intention to make every       exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in       dispute         we kept on our course between the south and west with variable       weather until the twentieth of the month when we found       ourselves on the debated ground being in latitude  degrees        s longitude  degrees  wthat is to say very nearly upon       the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the       group not perceiving any sign of land we continued to the       westward of the parallel of fiftythree degrees south as far as       the meridian of fifty degrees west we then stood to the north as       far as the parallel of fiftytwo degrees south when we turned to       the eastward and kept our parallel by double altitudes morning       and evening and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon       having thus gone eastwardly to the meridian of the western coast       of georgia we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude       from which we set out we then took diagonal courses throughout       the entire extent of sea circumscribed keeping a lookout       constantly at the masthead and repeating our examination with       the greatest care for a period of three weeks during which the       weather was remarkably pleasant and fair with no haze       whatsoever of course we were thoroughly satisfied that whatever       islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period       no vestige of them remained at the present day since my return       home i find that the same ground was traced over with equal       care in  by captain johnson of the american schooner       henry and by captain morrell in the american schooner waspin       both cases with the same result as in our own     chapter          it had been captain guys original intention after satisfying       himself about the auroras to proceed through the strait of       magellan and up along the western coast of patagonia but       information received at tristan dacunha induced him to steer to       the southward in the hope of falling in with some small islands       said to lie about the parallel of  degrees s longitude        degrees  w in the event of his not discovering these lands       he designed should the season prove favourable to push on       toward the pole accordingly on the twelfth of december we made       sail in that direction on the eighteenth we found ourselves       about the station indicated by glass and cruised for three days       in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he       had mentioned on the twentyfirst the weather being unusually       pleasant we again made sail to the southward with the       resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible       before entering upon this portion of my narrative it may be as       well for the information of those readers who have paid little       attention to the progress of discovery in these regions to give       some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the       southern pole which have hitherto been made        that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct       account in  he sailed to the south in the resolution       accompanied by lieutenant furneaux in the adventure in december       he found himself as far as the fiftyeighth parallel of south       latitude and in longitude  degrees  e here he met with       narrow fields of ice about eight or ten inches thick and       running northwest and southeast this ice was in large cakes and       usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great       difficulty in forcing a passage at this period captain cook       supposed from the vast number of birds to be seen and from       other indications that he was in the near vicinity of land he       kept on to the southward the weather being exceedingly cold       until he reached the sixtyfourth parallel in longitude        degrees  e here he had mild weather with gentle breezes for       five days the thermometer being at thirtysix in january        the vessels crossed the antarctic circle but did not succeed in       penetrating much farther for upon reaching latitude  degrees        they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of       ice extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye       could reach this ice was of every varietyand some large floes       of it miles in extent formed a compact mass rising eighteen or       twenty feet above the water it being late in the season and no       hope entertained of rounding these obstructions captain cook now       reluctantly turned to the northward        in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic       in latitude  degrees  he met with a strong current setting       to the southward in december when the vessels were in latitude        degrees  longitude  degrees  w the cold was       excessive with heavy gales and fog here also birds were       abundant the albatross the penguin and the peterel especially       in latitude  degrees  some large islands of ice were       encountered and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward       were observed to be of a snowy whiteness indicating the vicinity       of field ice in latitude  degrees  longitude  degrees        w the navigators were stopped as before by an immense       frozen expanse which filled the whole area of the southern       horizon the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken       so firmly wedged together as to be utterly impassible and       extending about a mile to the southward behind it the frozen       surface was comparatively smooth for some distance until       terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice       mountains the one towering above the other captain cook       concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was       joined to a continent mr j n reynolds whose great exertions       and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot       a national expedition partly for the purpose of exploring these       regions thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution we are       not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond        degrees  but we are astonished that he did attain that point       on the meridian of  degrees  west longitude palmers land       lies south of the shetland latitude sixtyfour degrees and       tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator       has yet penetrated cook was standing for this land when his       progress was arrested by the ice which we apprehend must       always be the case in that point and so early in the season as       the sixth of januaryand we should not be surprised if a portion       of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of       palmers land or to some other portions of land lying farther to       the southward and westward        in  captains kreutzenstern and lisiausky were dispatched by       alexander of russia for the purpose of circumnavigating the       globe in endeavouring to get south they made no farther than        degrees  in longitude  degrees  w they here met with       strong currents setting eastwardly whales were abundant but       they saw no ice in regard to this voyage mr reynolds observes       that if kreutzenstern had arrived where he did earlier in the       season he must have encountered iceit was march when he reached       the latitude specified the winds prevailing as they do from       the southward and westward had carried the floes aided by       currents into that icy region bounded on the north by georgia       east by sandwich land and the south orkneys and west by the       south shetland islands        in  captain james weddell of the british navy with two       very small vessels penetrated farther to the south than any       previous navigator and this too without encountering       extraordinary difficulties he states that although he was       frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the seventysecond       parallel yet upon attaining it not a particle was to be       discovered and that upon arriving at the latitude of  degrees        no fields and only three islands of ice were visible it is       somewhat remarkable that although vast flocks of birds were       seen and other usual indications of land and although south of       the shetlands unknown coasts were observed from the masthead       tending southwardly weddell discourages the idea of land       existing in the polar regions of the south        on the th of january  captain benjamin morrell of the       american schooner wasp sailed from kerguelens land with a view       of penetrating as far south as possible on the first of february       he found himself in latitude  degrees  s longitude        degrees  e the following passage is extracted from his       journal of that date the wind soon freshened to an elevenknot       breeze and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west       being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond       latitude sixtyfour degrees the less ice was to be apprehended       we steered a little to the southward until we crossed the       antarctic circle and were in latitude  degrees  e in this       latitude there was no field ice and very few ice islands in       sight        under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry the       sea was now entirely free of field ice and there were not more       than a dozen ice islands in sight at the same time the       temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees       higher more mild than we had ever found it between the       parallels of sixty and sixtytwo south we were now in latitude        degrees  s and the temperature of the air was       fortyseven and that of the water fortyfour in this situation       i found the variation to be  degrees  easterly per       azimuth i have several times passed within the antarctic       circle on different meridians and have uniformly found the       temperature both of the air and the water to become more and       more mild the farther i advanced beyond the sixtyfifth degree of       south latitude and that the variation decreases in the same       proportion while north of this latitude say between sixty and       sixtyfive south we frequently had great difficulty in finding a       passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable       ice islands some of which were from one to two miles in       circumference and more than five hundred feet above the surface       of the water        being nearly destitute of fuel and water and without proper       instruments it being also late in the season captain morrell       was now obliged to put back without attempting any further       progress to the westward although an entirely open sea lay       before him he expresses the opinion that had not these       overruling considerations obliged him to retreat he could have       penetrated if not to the pole itself at least to the       eightyfifth parallel i have given his ideas respecting these       matters somewhat at length that the reader may have an       opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own       subsequent experience        in  captain briscoe in the employ of the messieurs enderby       whaleship owners of london sailed in the brig lively for the       south seas accompanied by the cutter tula on the twentyeighth       of february being in latitude  degrees  s longitude        degrees  e he descried land and clearly discovered through       the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e s       e he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the       following month but was unable to approach the coast nearer than       within ten leagues owing to the boisterous state of the weather       finding it impossible to make further discovery during this       season he returned northward to winter in van diemens land        in the beginning of  he again proceeded southwardly and on       the fourth of february land was seen to the southeast in latitude        degrees  longitude  degrees  w this was soon found to       be an island near the headland of the country he had first       discovered on the twentyfirst of the month he succeeded in       landing on the latter and took possession of it in the name of       william iv calling it adelaides island in honour of the       english queen these particulars being made known to the royal       geographical society of london the conclusion was drawn by that       body that there is a continuous tract of land extending from        degrees  e to  degrees  w longitude running the       parallel of from sixtysix to sixtyseven degrees south       latitude in respect to this conclusion mr reynolds observes       in the correctness of it we by no means concur nor do the       discoveries of briscoe warrant any such indifference it was       within these limits that weddel proceeded south on a meridian to       the east of georgia sandwich land and the south orkney and       shetland islands my own experience will be found to testify       most directly to the falsity of the conclusion arrived at by the       society        these are the principal attempts which have been made at       penetrating to a high southern latitude and it will now be seen       that there remained previous to the voyage of the jane nearly       three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle       had not been crossed at all of course a wide field lay before us       for discovery and it was with feelings of most intense interest       that i heard captain guy express his resolution of pushing boldly       to the southward     chapter          we kept our course southwardly for four days after giving up the       search for glasss islands without meeting with any ice at all       on the twentysixth at noon we were in latitude  degrees        s longitude  degrees  w we now saw several large ice       islands and a floe of field ice not however of any great       extent the winds generally blew from the southeast or the       northeast but were very light whenever we had a westerly wind       which was seldom it was invariably attended with a rain squall       every day we had more or less snow the thermometer on the       twentyseventh stood at thirtyfive        january  this day we found ourselves completely hemmed in       by the ice and our prospects looked cheerless indeed a strong       gale blew during the whole forenoon from the northeast and       drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter       with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences       toward evening the gale still blowing with fury a large field       in front separated and we were enabled by carrying a press of       sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open       water beyond as we approached this space we took in sail by       degrees and having at length got clear layto under a single       reefed foresail        january we had now tolerably pleasant weather at noon we       found ourselves in latitude  degrees  s longitude        degrees  w having crossed the antarctic circle very little       ice was to be seen to the southward although large fields of it       lay behind us this day we rigged some sounding gear using a       large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons and a line of       two hundred fathoms we found the current setting to the north       about a quarter of a mile per hour the temperature of the air       was now about thirtythree here we found the variation to be        degrees  easterly per azimuth        january we had still held on to the southward without any very       great impediments on this morning however being in latitude        degrees  e longitude  degrees  w we were again brought       to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice we saw       nevertheless much open water to the southward and felt no doubt       of being able to reach it eventually standing to the eastward       along the edge of the floe we at length came to a passage of       about a mile in width through which we warped our way by       sundown the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with       ice islands but had no field ice and we pushed on boldly as       before the cold did not seem to increase although we had snow       very frequently and now and then hail squalls of great violence       immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day       going from southeast to northwest        january the sea still remained pretty well open so that we       had no difficulty in holding on our course to the westward we       saw some icebergs of incredible size and in the afternoon passed       very near one whose summit could not have been less than four       hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean its girth was       probably at the base threequarters of a league and several       streams of water were running from crevices in its sides we       remained in sight of this island two days and then only lost it       in a fog        january early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a       man overboard he was an american named peter vredenburgh a       native of new york and was one of the most valuable hands on       board the schooner in going over the bows his foot slipped and       he fell between two cakes of ice never rising again at noon of       this day we were in latitude  degrees  longitude  degrees        w the cold was now excessive and we had hail squalls       continually from the northward and eastward in this direction       also we saw several more immense icebergs and the whole horizon       to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice rising       in tiers one mass above the other some driftwood floated by       during the evening and a great quantity of birds flew over       among which were nellies peterels albatrosses and a large bird       of a brilliant blue plumage the variation here per azimuth was       less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic       circle        january our passage to the south again looked doubtful as       nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one       apparently limitless floe backed by absolute mountains of ragged       ice one precipice of which arose frowningly above the other we       stood to the westward until the fourteenth in the hope of       finding an entrance        january this morning we reached the western extremity of the       field which had impeded us and weathering it came to an open       sea without a particle of ice upon sounding with two hundred       fathoms we here found a current setting southwardly at the rate       of half a mile per hour the temperature of the air was       fortyseven that of the water thirtyfour we now sailed to the       southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the       sixteenth when at noon we were in latitude  degrees        longitude  degrees w we here again sounded and found a       current setting still southwardly and at the rate of three       quarters of a mile per hour the variation per azimuth had       diminished and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant       the thermometer being as high as fiftyone at this period not a       particle of ice was to be discovered all hands on board now felt       certain of attaining the pole        january this day was full of incident innumerable flights of       birds flew over us from the southward and several were shot from       the deck one of them a species of pelican proved to be       excellent eating about midday a small floe of ice was seen from       the masthead off the larboard bow and upon it there appeared to       be some large animal as the weather was good and nearly calm       captain guy ordered out two of the boats to see what it was dirk       peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat upon       coming up with the floe we perceived that it was in the       possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear       but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals being       well armed we made no scruple of attacking it at once several       shots were fired in quick succession the most of which took       effect apparently in the head and body nothing discouraged       however the monster threw himself from the ice and swam with       open jaws to the boat in which were peters and myself owing to       the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of       the adventure no person was ready immediately with a second       shot and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his       vast bulk across our gunwale and seizing one of the men by the       small of his back before any efficient means were taken to repel       him in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of       peters saved us from destruction leaping upon the back of the       huge beast he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck       reaching the spinal marrow at a blow the brute tumbled into the       sea lifeless and without a struggle rolling over peters as he       fell the latter soon recovered himself and a rope being thrown       him he secured the carcass before entering the boat we then       returned in triumph to the schooner towing our trophy behind us       this bear upon admeasurement proved to be full fifteen feet in       his greatest length his wool was perfectly white and very       coarse curling tightly the eyes were of a blood red and larger       than those of the arctic bear the snout also more rounded       rather resembling the snout of the bulldog the meat was tender       but excessively rank and fishy although the men devoured it with       avidity and declared it excellent eating        scarcely had we got our prize alongside when the man at the       masthead gave the joyful shout of land on the starboard bow       all hands were now upon the alert and a breeze springing up       very opportunely from the northward and eastward we were soon       close in with the coast it proved to be a low rocky islet of       about a league in circumference and altogether destitute of       vegetation if we except a species of prickly pear in       approaching it from the northward a singular ledge of rock is       seen projecting into the sea and bearing a strong resemblance to       corded bales of cotton around this ledge to the westward is a       small bay at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient       landing        it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island       but with one exception we found nothing worthy of our       observation in the southern extremity we picked up near the       shore half buried in a pile of loose stones a piece of wood       which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe there had been       evidently some attempt at carving upon it and captain guy       fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise but the       resemblance did not strike me very forcibly besides this prow       if such it were we found no other token that any living creature       had ever been here before around the coast we discovered       occasional small floes of icebut these were very few the exact       situation of the islet to which captain guy gave the name of       bennets islet in honour of his partner in the ownership of the       schooner is  degrees  s latitude  degrees  w       longitude        we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees       farther than any previous navigators and the sea still lay       perfectly open before us we found too that the variation       uniformly decreased as we proceeded and what was still more       surprising that the temperature of the air and latterly of the       water became milder the weather might even be called pleasant       and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some       northern point of the compass the sky was usually clear with       now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern       horizonthis however was invariably of brief duration two       difficulties alone presented themselves to our view we were       getting short of fuel and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among       several of the crew these considerations began to impress upon       captain guy the necessity of returning and he spoke of it       frequently for my own part confident as i was of soon arriving       at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing and       having every reason to believe from present appearances that we       should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher arctic       latitudes i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of       persevering at least for a few days longer in the direction we       were now holding so tempting an opportunity of solving the great       problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been       afforded to man and i confess that i felt myself bursting with       indignation at the timid and illtimed suggestions of our       commander i believe indeed that what i could not refrain from       saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push       on while therefore i cannot but lament the most unfortunate       and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice i must       still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having       been instrumental however remotely in opening to the eye of       science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever       engrossed its attention     chapter          january this morning  we continued to the southward with       the same pleasant weather as before the sea was entirely smooth       the air tolerably warm and from the northeast the temperature of       the water fiftythree we now again got our soundinggear in       order and with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line found the       current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour       this constant tendency to the southward both in the wind and       current caused some degree of speculation and even of alarm in       different quarters of the schooner and i saw distinctly that no       little impression had been made upon the mind of captain guy he       was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule however and i finally       succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions the variation       was now very trivial in the course of the day we saw several       large whales of the right species and innumerable flights of the       albatross passed over the vessel we also picked up a bush full       of red berries like those of the hawthorn and the carcass of a       singularlooking landanimal it was three feet in length and       but six inches in height with four very short legs the feet       armed with long claws of a brilliant scarlet and resembling       coral in substance the body was covered with a straight silky       hair perfectly white the tail was peaked like that of a rat       and about a foot and a half long the head resembled a cats       with the exception of the earsthese were flopped like the ears       of a dog the teeth were of the same brilliant scarlet as the       claws        january today being in latitude  degrees  longitude        degrees  w the sea being of an extraordinarily dark       colour we again saw land from the masthead and upon a closer       scrutiny found it to be one of a group of very large islands       the shore was precipitous and the interior seemed to be well       wooded a circumstance which occasioned us great joy in about       four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor       in ten fathoms sandy bottom a league from the coast as a high       surf with strong ripples here and there rendered a nearer       approach of doubtful expediency the two largest boats were now       ordered out and a party well armed among whom were peters and       myself proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which       appeared to encircle the island after searching about for some       time we discovered an inlet which we were entering when we saw       four large canoes put off from the shore filled with men who       seemed to be well armed we waited for them to come up and as       they moved with great rapidity they were soon within hail       captain guy now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an       oar when the strangers made a full stop and commenced a loud       jabbering all at once intermingled with occasional shouts in       which we could distinguish the words anamoomoo and lamalama       they continued this for at least half an hour during which we       had a good opportunity of observing their appearance        in the four canoes which might have been fifty feet long and       five broad there were a hundred and ten savages in all they       were about the ordinary stature of europeans but of a more       muscular and brawny frame their complexion a jet black with       thick and long woolly hair they were clothed in skins of an       unknown black animal shaggy and silky and made to fit the body       with some degree of skill the hair being inside except where       turned out about the neck wrists and ankles their arms       consisted principally of clubs of a dark and apparently very       heavy wood some spears however were observed among them       headed with flint and a few slings the bottoms of the canoes       were full of black stones about the size of a large egg        when they had concluded their harangue for it was clear they       intended their jabbering for such one of them who seemed to be       the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe and made signs for       us to bring our boats alongside of him this hint we pretended       not to understand thinking it the wiser plan to maintain if       possible the interval between us as their number more than       quadrupled our own finding this to be the case the chief       ordered the three other canoes to hold back while he advanced       toward us with his own as soon as he came up with us he leaped       on board the largest of our boats and seated himself by the side       of captain guy pointing at the same time to the schooner and       repeating the word anamoomoo and lamalama we now put back to       the vessel the four canoes following at a little distance        upon getting alongside the chief evinced symptoms of extreme       surprise and delight clapping his hands slapping his thighs and       breast and laughing obstreperously his followers behind joined       in his merriment and for some minutes the din was so excessive       as to be absolutely deafening quiet being at length restored       captain guy ordered the boats to be hoisted up as a necessary       precaution and gave the chief whose name we soon found to be       toowit to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of       his men on deck at one time with this arrangement he appeared       perfectly satisfied and gave some directions to the canoes when       one of them approached the rest remaining about fifty yards off       twenty of the savages now got on board and proceeded to ramble       over every part of the deck and scramble about among the       rigging making themselves much at home and examining every       article with great inquisitiveness        it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the       white racefrom whose complexion indeed they appeared to       recoil they believed the jane to be a living creature and       seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their       spears carefully turning them up our crew were much amused with       the conduct of toowit in one instance the cook was splitting       some wood near the galley and by accident struck his axe into       the deck making a gash of considerable depth the chief       immediately ran up and pushing the cook on one side rather       roughly commenced a half whine half howl strongly indicative       of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner       patting and smoothing the gash with his hand and washing it from       a bucket of seawater which stood by this was a degree of       ignorance for which we were not prepared and for my part i could       not help thinking some of it affected        when the visitors had satisfied as well as they could their       curiosity in regard to our upper works they were admitted below       when their amazement exceeded all bounds their astonishment now       appeared to be far too deep for words for they roamed about in       silence broken only by low ejaculations the arms afforded them       much food for speculation and they were suffered to handle and       examine them at leisure i do not believe that they had the least       suspicion of their actual use but rather took them for idols       seeing the care we had of them and the attention with which we       watched their movements while handling them at the great guns       their wonder was redoubled they approached them with every mark       of the profoundest reverence and awe but forbore to examine them       minutely there were two large mirrors in the cabin and here was       the acme of their amazement toowit was the first to approach       them and he had got in the middle of the cabin with his face to       one and his back to the other before he fairly perceived them       upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass       i thought the savage would go mad but upon turning short round       to make a retreat and beholding himself a second time in the       opposite direction i was afraid he would expire upon the spot       no persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look       throwing himself upon the floor with his face buried in his       hands he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon       deck        the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner       twenty at a time toowit being suffered to remain during the       entire period we saw no disposition to thievery among them nor       did we miss a single article after their departure throughout       the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner       there were however some points in their demeanour which we       found it impossible to understand for example we could not get       them to approach several very harmless objectssuch as the       schooners sails an egg an open book or a pan of flour we       endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles       which might be turned to account in the way of traffic but found       great difficulty in being comprehended we made out       nevertheless what greatly astonished us that the islands       abounded in the large tortoise of the gallipagos one of which we       saw in the canoe of toowit we saw also some biche de mer in the       hands of one of the savages who was greedily devouring it in its       natural state these anomaliesfor they were such when considered       in regard to the latitudeinduced captain guy to wish for a       thorough investigation of the country in the hope of making a       profitable speculation in his discovery for my own part anxious       as i was to know something more of these islands i was still       more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward       without delay we had now fine weather but there was no telling       how long it would last and being already in the eightyfourth       parallel with an open sea before us a current setting strongly       to the southward and the wind fair i could not listen with any       patience to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely       necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a       proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions i represented to the       captain that we might easily make this group on our return and       winter here in the event of being blocked up by the ice he at       length came into my views for in some way hardly known to       myself i had acquired much influence over him and it was       finally resolved that even in the event of our finding biche de       mer we should only stay here a week to recruit and then push on       to the southward while we might accordingly we made every       necessary preparation and under the guidance of toowit got       the jane through the reef in safety coming to anchor about a       mile from the shore in an excellent bay completely landlocked       on the southeastern coast of the main island and in ten fathoms       of water black sandy bottom at the head of this bay there were       three fine springs we were told of good water and we saw       abundance of wood in the vicinity the four canoes followed us       in keeping however at a respectful distance toowit himself       remained on board and upon our dropping anchor invited us to       accompany him on shore and visit his village in the interior to       this captain guy consented and ten savages being left on board       as hostages a party of us twelve in all got in readiness to       attend the chief we took care to be well armed yet without       evincing any distrust the schooner had her guns run out her       boardingnettings up and every other proper precaution was taken       to guard against surprise directions were left with the chief       mate to admit no person on board during our absence and in the       event of our not appearing in twelve hours to send the cutter       with a swivel around the island in search of us        at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us       that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto       visited by civilized men we saw nothing with which we had been       formerly conversant the trees resembled no growth of either the       torrid the temperate or the northern frigid zones and were       altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had       already traversed the very rocks were novel in their mass their       color and their stratification and the streams themselves       utterly incredible as it may appear had so little in common with       those of other climates that we were scrupulous of tasting them       and indeed had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that       their qualities were purely those of nature at a small brook       which crossed our path the first we had reached toowit and his       attendants halted to drink on account of the singular character       of the water we refused to taste it supposing it to be       polluted and it was not until some time afterward we came to       understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout       the whole group i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the       nature of this liquid and cannot do so without many words       although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common       water would do so yet never except when falling in a cascade       had it the customary appearance of limpidity it was       nevertheless in point of fact as perfectly limpid as any       limestone water in existence the difference being only in       appearance at first sight and especially in cases where little       declivity was found it bore resemblance as regards consistency       to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water but this was       only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities it was       not colourless nor was it of any one uniform colourpresenting       to the eye as it flowed every possible shade of purple like       the hues of a changeable silk this variation in shade was       produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in       the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of       toowit upon collecting a basinful and allowing it to settle       thoroughly we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made       up of a number of distinct veins each of a distinct hue that       these veins did not commingle and that their cohesion was       perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves and       imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins upon passing the blade       of a knife athwart the veins the water closed over it       immediately as with us and also in withdrawing it all traces       of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated if       however the blade was passed down accurately between the two       veins a perfect separation was effected which the power of       cohesion did not immediately rectify the phenomena of this water       formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent       miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled     chapter          we were nearly three hours in reaching the village it being more       than nine miles in the interior and the path lying through a       rugged country as we passed along the party of toowit the       whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes was momentarily       strengthened by smaller detachments of from two to six or seven       which joined us as if by accident at different turns of the       road there appeared so much of system in this that i could not       help feeling distrust and i spoke to captain guy of my       apprehensions it was now too late however to recede and we       concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect       confidence in the good faith of toowit we accordingly went on       keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages and not       permitting them to divide our numbers by pushing in between in       this way passing through a precipitous ravine we at length       reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations       upon the island as we came in sight of them the chief set up a       shout and frequently repeated the word klockklock which we       supposed to be the name of the village or perhaps the generic       name for villages        the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable       and unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with       which mankind are acquainted were of no uniform plan some of       them and these we found belonged to the wampoos or yampoos the       great men of the land consisted of a tree cut down at about four       feet from the root with a large black skin thrown over it and       hanging in loose folds upon the ground under this the savage       nestled others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees       with the withered foliage upon them made to recline at an angle       of fortyfive degrees against a bank of clay heaped up without       regular form to the height of five or six feet others again       were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly and covered       over with similar branches these being removed when the tenant       was about to enter and pulled on again when he had entered a       few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood the       upper limbs being partially cut through so as to bend over upon       the lower thus forming thicker shelter from the weather the       greater number however consisted of small shallow caverns       apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark       stone resembling fullers earth with which three sides of the       village were bounded at the door of each of these primitive       caverns was a small rock which the tenant carefully placed       before the entrance upon leaving his residence for what purpose       i could not ascertain as the stone itself was never of       sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening        this village if it were worthy of the name lay in a valley of       some depth and could only be approached from the southward the       precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all       access in other directions through the middle of the valley ran       a brawling stream of the same magicallooking water which has       been described we saw several strange animals about the       dwellings all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated the       largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the       structure of the body and snout the tail however was bushy       and the legs slender as those of the antelope its motion was       exceedingly awkward and indecisive and we never saw it attempt       to run we noticed also several animals very similar in       appearance but of a greater length of body and covered with a       black wool there were a great variety of tame fowls running       about and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the       natives to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these       birds in a state of entire domestication going to sea       periodically for food but always returning to the village as a       home and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of       incubation there they were joined by their friends the pelicans       as usual but these latter never followed them to the dwellings       of the savages among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks       differing very little from the canvassback of our own country       black gannets and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in       appearance but not carnivorous of fish there seemed to be a       great abundance we saw during our visit a quantity of dried       salmon rock cod blue dolphins mackerel blackfish skate       conger eels elephantfish mullets soles parrotfish       leatherjackets gurnards hake flounders paracutas and       innumerable other varieties we noticed too that most of them       were similar to the fish about the group of lord auckland       islands in a latitude as low as fiftyone degrees south the       gallipago tortoise was also very plentiful we saw but few wild       animals and none of a large size or of a species with which we       were familiar one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed       our path but the natives paid them little attention and we       concluded that they were not venomous        as we approached the village with toowit and his party a vast       crowd of the people rushed out to meet us with loud shouts       among which we could only distinguish the everlasting anamoomoo       and lamalama we were much surprised at perceiving that with       one or two exceptions these new comers were entirely naked and       skins being used only by the men of the canoes all the weapons       of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter       for there was no appearance of any among the villagers there       were a great many women and children the former not altogether       wanting in what might be termed personal beauty they were       straight tall and well formed with a grace and freedom of       carriage not to be found in civilized society their lips       however like those of the men were thick and clumsy so that       even when laughing the teeth were never disclosed their hair       was of a finer texture than that of the males among these naked       villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed       like the party of toowit in dresses of black skin and armed       with lances and heavy clubs these appeared to have great       influence among the rest and were always addressed by the title       wampoo these too were the tenants of the black skin palaces       that of toowit was situated in the centre of the village and       was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of       its kind the tree which formed its support was cut off at a       distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root and there       were several branches left just below the cut these serving to       extend the covering and in this way prevent its flapping about       the trunk the covering too which consisted of four very large       skins fastened together with wooden skewers was secured at the       bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground the floor       was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet        to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity and as many       of the natives crowded in after us as possible toowit seated       himself on the leaves and made signs that we should follow his       example this we did and presently found ourselves in a       situation peculiarly uncomfortable if not indeed critical we       were on the ground twelve in number with the savages as many       as forty sitting on their hams so closely around us that if any       disturbance had arisen we should have found it impossible to       make use of our arms or indeed to have risen to our feet the       pressure was not only inside the tent but outside where       probably was every individual on the whole island the crowd       being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant       exertions and vociferations of toowit our chief security lay       however in the presence of toowit himself among us and we       resolved to stick by him closely as the best chance of       extricating ourselves from the dilemma sacrificing him       immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design        after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored when       the chief addressed us in a speech of great length and very       nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes with the       exception that the anamoomoos were now somewhat more       strenuously insisted upon than the lamalamas we listened in       profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue when       captain guy replied by assuring the chief of his eternal       friendship and goodwill concluding what he had to say by a       present of several strings of blue beads and a knife at the       former the monarch much to our surprise turned up his nose with       some expression of contempt but the knife gave him the most       unlimited satisfaction and he immediately ordered dinner this       was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants and       consisted of the palpitating entrails of a specialis of unknown       animal probably one of the slimlegged hogs which we had       observed in our approach to the village seeing us at a loss how       to proceed he began by way of setting us an example to devour       yard after yard of the enticing food until we could positively       stand it no longer and evinced such manifest symptoms of       rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of       astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the       lookingglasses we declined however partaking of the       delicacies before us and endeavoured to make him understand that       we had no appetite whatever having just finished a hearty       dejeuner        when the monarch had made an end of his meal we commenced a       series of crossquestioning in every ingenious manner we could       devise with a view of discovering what were the chief       productions of the country and whether any of them might be       turned to profit at length he seemed to have some idea of our       meaning and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he       assured us the biche de mer pointing to a specimen of that       animal was to be found in great abundance we were glad of this       early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd       and signified our eagerness to proceed we now left the tent       and accompanied by the whole population of the village followed       the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island nor far       from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor we waited here for       about an hour until the four canoes were brought around by some       of the savages to our station the whole of our party then       getting into one of them we were paddled along the edge of the       reef before mentioned and of another still farther out where we       saw a far greater quantity of biche de mer than the oldest seamen       among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes       most celebrated for this article of commerce we stayed near       these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could       easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary when we       were taken alongside the schooner and parted with toowit after       obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us in the       course of twentyfour hours as many of the canvassback ducks       and gallipago tortoises as his canoes would hold in the whole of       this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives       calculated to create suspicion with the single exception of the       systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during       our route from the schooner to the village     chapter          the chief was as good as his word and we were soon plentifully       supplied with fresh provisions we found the tortoises as fine as       we had ever seen and the ducks surpassed our best species of       wild fowl being exceedingly tender juicy and wellflavoured       besides these the savages brought us upon our making them       comprehend our wishes a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy       grass with a canoeload of fresh fish and some dried the celery       was a treat indeed and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable       benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of       disease in a very short time we had not a single person on the       sicklist we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions       among which may be mentioned a species of shellfish resembling       the mussel in shape but with the taste of an oyster shrimps       too and prawns were abundant and albatross and other birds       eggs with dark shells we took in too a plentiful stock of the       flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before most of the men       found it a palatable food but i thought it fishy and otherwise       disagreeable in return for these good things we presented the       natives with blue beads brass trinkets nails knives and       pieces of red cloth they being fully delighted in the exchange       we established a regular market on shore just under the guns of       the schooner where our barterings were carried on with every       appearance of good faith and a degree of order which their       conduct at the village of klockklock had not led us to expect       from the savages        matters went on thus very amicably for several days during which       parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner and       parties of our men frequently on shore making long excursions       into the interior and receiving no molestation whatever finding       the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with biche de       mer owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders and the       readiness with which they would render us assistance in       collecting it captain guy resolved to enter into negotiations       with toowit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure       the article and for the services of himself and tribe in       gathering as much as possible while he himself took advantage of       the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward upon       mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to       enter into an agreement a bargain was accordingly struck       perfectly satisfactory to both parties by which it was arranged       that after making the necessary preparations such as laying off       the proper grounds erecting a portion of the buildings and       doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be       required the schooner should proceed on her route leaving three       of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the       project and instruct the natives in drying the biche de mer       in regard to terms these were made to depend upon the exertions       of the savages in our absence they were to receive a stipulated       quantity of blue beads knives red cloth and so forth for       every certain number of piculs of the biche de mer which should       be ready on our return        a description of the nature of this important article of       commerce and the method of preparing it may prove of some       interest to my readers and i can find no more suitable place       than this for introducing an account of it the following       comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern       history of a voyage to the south seas        it is that mollusca from the indian seas which is known to       commerce by the french name bouche de mer a nice morsel from       the sea if i am not much mistaken the celebrated cuvier calls       it gasteropeda pulmonifera it is abundantly gathered in the       coasts of the pacific islands and gathered especially for the       chinese market where it commands a great price perhaps as much       as their muchtalkedof edible birds nests which are properly       made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of       swallow from the body of these molluscae they have no shell no       legs nor any prominent part except an absorbing and an       excretory opposite organs but by their elastic wings like       caterpillars or worms they creep in shallow waters in which       when low they can be seen by a kind of swallow the sharp bill       of which inserted in the soft animal draws a gummy and       filamentous substance which by drying can be wrought into the       solid walls of their nest hence the name of gasteropeda       pulmonifera        this mollusca is oblong and of different sizes from three to       eighteen inches in length and i have seen a few that were not       less than two feet long they were nearly round a little       flattish on one side which lies next to the bottom of the sea       and they are from one to eight inches thick they crawl up into       shallow water at particular seasons of the year probably for the       purpose of gendering as we often find them in pairs it is when       the sun has the most power on the water rendering it tepid that       they approach the shore and they often go up into places so       shallow that on the tides receding they are left dry exposed       to the beat of the sun but they do not bring forth their young       in shallow water as we never see any of their progeny and       fullgrown ones are always observed coming in from deep water       they feed principally on that class of zoophytes which produce       the coral        the biche de mer is generally taken in three or four feet of       water after which they are brought on shore and split at one       end with a knife the incision being one inch or more according       to the size of the mollusca through this opening the entrails       are forced out by pressure and they are much like those of any       other small tenant of the deep the article is then washed and       afterward boiled to a certain degree which must not be too much       or too little they are then buried in the ground for four hours       then boiled again for a short time after which they are dried       either by the fire or the sun those cured by the sun are worth       the most but where one picul   lbs can be cured that       way i can cure thirty piculs by the fire when once properly       cured they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years       without any risk but they should be examined once in every few       months say four times a year to see if any dampness is likely       to affect them        the chinese as before stated consider biche de mer a very       great luxury believing that it wonderfully strengthens and       nourishes the system and renews the exhausted system of the       immoderate voluptuary the first quality commands a high price in       canton being worth ninety dollars a picul the second quality       seventyfive dollars the third fifty dollars the fourth       thirty dollars the fifth twenty dollars the sixth twelve       dollars the seventh eight dollars and the eighth four       dollars small cargoes however will often bring more in       manilla singapore and batavia        an agreement having been thus entered into we proceeded       immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the       buildings and clearing the ground a large flat space near the       eastern shore of the bay was selected where there was plenty of       both wood and water and within a convenient distance of the       principal reefs on which the biche de mer was to be procured       we now all set to work in good earnest and soon to the great       astonishment of the savages had felled a sufficient number of       trees for our purpose getting them quickly in order for the       framework of the houses which in two or three days were so far       under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the       three men whom we intended to leave behind these were john       carson alfred harris and  peterson all natives of london i       believe who volunteered their services in this respect        by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for       departure we had agreed however to pay a formal visit of       leavetaking to the village and toowit insisted so       pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think       it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal       i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest       suspicion of the good faith of the savages they had uniformly       behaved with the greatest decorum aiding us with alacrity in our       work offering us their commodities frequently without price       and never in any instance pilfering a single article although       the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident       by the extravagant demonstrations of joy always manifested upon       our making them a present the women especially were most       obliging in every respect and upon the whole we should have       been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a       single thought of perfidy on the part of a people who treated us       so well a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent       kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan       for our destruction and that the islanders for whom we       entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem were among the       most barbarous subtle and bloodthirsty wretches that ever       contaminated the face of the globe        it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the       purpose of visiting the village although as said before we       entertained not the slightest suspicion still no proper       precaution was neglected six men were left in the schooner with       instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel       during our absence under any pretence whatever and to remain       constantly on deck the boardingnettings were up the guns       doubleshotted with grape and canister and the swivels loaded       with canisters of musketballs she lay with her anchor apeak       about a mile from the shore and no canoe could approach her in       any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the       full fire of our swivels immediately        the six men being left on board our shoreparty consisted of       thirtytwo persons in all we were armed to the teeth having       with us muskets pistols and cutlasses besides each had a long       kind of seamans knife somewhat resembling the bowie knife now       so much used throughout our western and southern country a       hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the       purpose of accompanying us on our way we noticed however with       some surprise that they were now entirely without arms and       upon questioning toowit in relation to this circumstance he       merely answered that mattee non we pa pa simeaning that there       was no need of arms where all were brothers we took this in good       part and proceeded        we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke and       were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain       of soapstone hills among which the village was situated this       gorge was very rocky and uneven so much so that it was with no       little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to       klockklock the whole length of the ravine might have been a       mile and a half or probably two miles it wound in every       possible direction through the hills having apparently formed       at some remote period the bed of a torrent in no instance       proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn the       sides of this dell would have averaged i am sure seventy or       eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of       their extent and in some portions they arose to an astonishing       height overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of       the light of day could penetrate the general width was about       forty feet and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the       passage of more than five or six persons abreast in short there       could be no place in the world better adapted for the       consummation of an ambuscade and it was no more than natural       that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it       when i now think of our egregious folly the chief subject of       astonishment seems to be that we should have ever ventured       under any circumstances so completely into the power of unknown       savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in       our progress through this ravine yet such was the order we       blindly took up trusting foolishly to the force of our party       the unarmed condition of toowit and his men the certain       efficacy of our firearms whose effect was yet a secret to the       natives and more than all to the longsustained pretension of       friendship kept up by these infamous wretches five or six of       them went on before as if to lead the way ostentatiously       busying themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from       the path next came our own party we walked closely together       taking care only to prevent separation behind followed the main       body of the savages observing unusual order and decorum        dirk peters a man named wilson allen and myself were on the       right of our companions examining as we went along the       singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us a       fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention it was about       wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing and       extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a       straight course sloping afterward to the left the height of the       opening is far as we could see into it from the main gorge was       perhaps sixty or seventy feet there were one or two stunted       shrubs growing from the crevices bearing a species of filbert       which i felt some curiosity to examine and pushed in briskly for       that purpose gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp and       then hastily retreating as i turned i found that peters and       allen had followed me i desired them to go back as there was       not room for two persons to pass saying they should have some of       my nuts they accordingly turned and were scrambling back allen       being close to the mouth of the fissure when i was suddenly       aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before       experienced and which impressed me with a vague conception if       indeed i then thought of anything that the whole foundations of       the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder and that the day of       universal dissolution was at hand     chapter          as soon as i could collect my scattered senses i found myself       nearly suffocated and grovelling in utter darkness among a       quantity of loose earth which was also falling upon me heavily       in every direction threatening to bury me entirely horribly       alarmed at this idea i struggled to gain my feet and at last       succeeded i then remained motionless for some moments       endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me and where i       was presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear and afterward       the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name       of god i scrambled one or two paces forward when i fell       directly over the head and shoulders of my companion who i soon       discovered was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his       middle and struggling desperately to free himself from the       pressure i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i       could command and at length succeeded in getting him out        as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise       to be capable of conversing rationally we both came to the       conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured       had by some convulsion of nature or probably from their own       weight caved in overhead and that we were consequently lost for       ever being thus entombed alive for a long time we gave up       supinely to the most intense agony and despair such as cannot be       adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar       position i firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in       the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the       supremeness of mental and bodily distress than a case like our       own of living inhumation the blackness of darkness which       envelops the victim the terrific oppression of lungs the       stifling fumes from the damp earth unite with the ghastly       considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of hope       and that such is the allotted portion of the dead to carry into       the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be       toleratednever to be conceived        at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain       precisely the extent of our calamity and grope about our prison       it being barely possible he observed that some opening might       yet be left us for escape i caught eagerly at this hope and       arousing myself to exertion attempted to force my way through       the loose earth hardly had i advanced a single step before a       glimmer of light became perceptible enough to convince me that       at all events we should not immediately perish for want of air       we now took some degree of heart and encouraged each other to       hope for the best having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which       impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light we       found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some       relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented       us presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects       around and discovered that we were near the extremity of the       straight portion of the fissure where it made a turn to the       left a few struggles more and we reached the bend when to our       inexpressible joy there appeared a long seam or crack extending       upward a vast distance generally at an angle of about fortyfive       degrees although sometimes much more precipitous we could not       see through the whole extent of this opening but as a good deal       of light came down it we had little doubt of finding at the top       of it if we could by any means reach the top a clear passage       into the open air        i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure       from the main gorge and that our companion allen was still       missing we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for       him after a long search and much danger from the farther caving       in of the earth above us peters at length cried out to me that       he had hold of our companions foot and that his whole body was       deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of       extricating him i soon found that what he said was too true and       that of course life had been long extinct with sorrowful       hearts therefore we left the corpse to its fate and again made       our way to the bend        the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us and       after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up we began once       more to despair i have before said that the chain of hills       through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of       soft rock resembling soapstone the sides of the cleft we were       now attempting to ascend were of the same material and so       excessively slippery being wet that we could get but little       foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts in some       places where the ascent was nearly perpendicular the difficulty       was of course much aggravated and indeed for some time we       thought insurmountable we took courage however from despair       and what by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our       bowie knives and swinging at the risk of our lives to small       projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and       then protruded from the general mass we at length reached a       natural platform from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky       at the extremity of a thicklywooded ravine looking back now       with somewhat more leisure at the passage through which we had       thus far proceeded we clearly saw from the appearance of its       sides that it was of late formation and we concluded that the       concussion whatever it was which had so unexpectedly       overwhelmed us had also at the same moment laid open this path       for escape being quite exhausted with exertion and indeed so       weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate peters       now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to       the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our       girdlesthe muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the       loose earth at the bottom of the chasm subsequent events proved       that had we fired we should have sorely repented it but       luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in       my mind and we forbore to let the savages know of our       whereabouts        after having reposed for about an hour we pushed on slowly up       the ravine and had gone no great way before we heard a       succession of tremendous yells at length we reached what might       be called the surface of the ground for our path hitherto since       leaving the platform had lain beneath an archway of high rock       and foliage at a vast distance overhead with great caution we       stole to a narrow opening through which we had a clear sight of       the surrounding country when the whole dreadful secret of the       concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view        the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the       highest peak in the range of the soapstone hills the gorge in       which our party of thirtytwo had entered ran within fifty feet       to the left of us but for at least one hundred yards the       channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the       chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that       had been artificially tumbled within it the means by which the       vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than       evident for sure traces of the murderous work were yet       remaining in several spots along the top of the eastern side of       the gorge we were now on the western might be seen stakes of       wood driven into the earth in these spots the earth had not       given way but throughout the whole extent of the face of the       precipice from which the mass had fallen it was clear from       marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the       rock blaster that stakes similar to those we saw standing had       been inserted at not more than a yard apart for the length of       perhaps three hundred feet and ranging at about ten feet back       from the edge of the gulf strong cords of grape vine were       attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill and it was       evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the       other stakes i have already spoken of the singular       stratification of these soapstone hills and the description just       given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected       our escape from inhumation will afford a further conception of       its nature this was such that almost every natural convulsion       would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or       ridges running parallel with one another and a very moderate       exertion of art would be sufficient for effecting the same       purpose of this stratification the savages had availed       themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends there can be no       doubt that by the continuous line of stakes a partial rupture       of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one       or two feet when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each       of the cords these cords being attached to the tops of the       stakes and extending back from the edge of the cliff a vast       leverage power was obtained capable of hurling the whole face of       the hill upon a given signal into the bosom of the abyss below       the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of       uncertainty we alone had escaped from the tempest of that       overwhelming destruction we were the only living white men upon       the island     chapter          our situation as it now appeared was scarcely less dreadful       than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever we saw       before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the       savages or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity       among them we might to be sure conceal ourselves for a time       from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills and as       a final resort in the chasm from which we had just issued but       we must either perish in the long polar winter through cold and       famine or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain       relief        the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages       crowds of whom we now perceived had come over from the islands       to the southward on flat rafts doubtless with a view of lending       their aid in the capture and plunder of the jane the vessel       still lay calmly at anchor in the bay those on board being       apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them how we       longed at that moment to be with them either to aid in effecting       their escape or to perish with them in attempting a defence we       saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without       bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads with but a       remote hope of benefit to them a pistol fired might suffice to       apprise them that something wrong had occurred but the report       could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety       lay in getting out of the harbour forthwithit could not tell       them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain that       their companions were no longer among the living upon hearing       the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet       the foe who were now getting ready to attack than they already       were and always had been no good therefore and infinite harm       would result from our firing and after mature deliberation we       forbore        our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel to       seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay       and endeavour to force a passage on board but the utter       impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became       evident the country as i said before was literally swarming       with the natives skulking among the bushes and recesses of the       hills so as not to be observed from the schooner in our       immediate vicinity especially and blockading the sole path by       which we could hope to attain the shore at the proper point were       stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors with       toowit at their head and apparently only waiting for some       reenforcement to commence his onset upon the jane the canoes       too which lay at the head of the bay were manned with savages       unarmed it is true but who undoubtedly had arms within reach       we were forced therefore however unwillingly to remain in our       place of concealment mere spectators of the conflict which       presently ensued        in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts or       flatboats without riggers filled with savages and coming round       the southern bight of the harbor they appeared to have no arms       except short clubs and stones which lay in the bottom of the       rafts immediately afterward another detachment still larger       appeared in an opposite direction and with similar weapons the       four canoes too were now quickly filled with natives starting       up from the bushes at the head of the bay and put off swiftly to       join the other parties thus in less time than i have taken to       tell it and as if by magic the jane saw herself surrounded by       an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing       her at all hazards        that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an       instant the six men left in the vessel however resolutely they       might engage in her defence were altogether unequal to the       proper management of the guns or in any manner to sustain a       contest at such odds i could hardly imagine that they would make       resistance at all but in this was deceived for presently i saw       them get springs upon the cable and bring the vessels starboard       broadside to bear upon the canoes which by this time were within       pistol range the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to       windward owing to some cause unknown but most probably to the       agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless       a situation the discharge was an entire failure not a canoe was       hit or a single savage injured the shots striking short and       ricocheting over their heads the only effect produced upon them       was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke which was so       excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would       abandon their design entirely and return to the shore and this       they would most likely have done had our men followed up their       broadside by a discharge of small arms in which as the canoes       were now so near at hand they could not have failed in doing       some execution sufficient at least to deter this party from a       farther advance until they could have given the rafts also a       broadside but in place of this they left the canoe party to       recover from their panic and by looking about them to see that       no injury had been sustained while they flew to the larboard to       get ready for the rafts        the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect the       star and doubleheaded shot of the large guns cut seven or eight       of the rafts completely asunder and killed perhaps thirty or       forty of the savages outright while a hundred of them at least       were thrown into the water the most of them dreadfully wounded       the remainder frightened out of their senses commenced at once       a precipitate retreat not even waiting to pick up their maimed       companions who were swimming about in every direction screaming       and yelling for aid this great success however came too late       for the salvation of our devoted people the canoe party were       already on board the schooner to the number of more than a       hundred and fifty the most of them having succeeded in       scrambling up the chains and over the boardingnetting even       before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns nothing       now could withstand their brute rage our men were borne down at       once overwhelmed trodden under foot and absolutely torn to       pieces in an instant        seeing this the savages on the rafts got the better of their       fears and came up in shoals to the plunder in five minutes the       jane was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage       the decks were split open and ripped up the cordage sails and       everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic while by       dint of pushing at the stern towing with the canoes and hauling       at the sides as they swam in thousands around the vessel the       wretches finally forced her on shore the cable having been       slipped and delivered her over to the good offices of toowit       who during the whole of the engagement had maintained like a       skilful general his post of security and reconnaissance among       the hills but now that the victory was completed to his       satisfaction condescended to scamper down with his warriors of       the black skin and become a partaker in the spoils        toowits descent left us at liberty to quit our hiding place and       reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm at about fifty       yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water at       which we slaked the burning thirst that now consumed us not far       from the spring we discovered several of the filbertbushes which       i mentioned before upon tasting the nuts we found them       palatable and very nearly resembling in flavour the common       english filbert we collected our hats full immediately       deposited them within the ravine and returned for more while we       were busily employed in gathering these a rustling in the bushes       alarmed us and we were upon the point of stealing back to our       covert when a large black bird of the bittern species       strugglingly and slowly arose above the shrubs i was so much       startled that i could do nothing but peters had sufficient       presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape       and seize it by the neck its struggles and screams were       tremendous and we had thoughts of letting it go lest the noise       should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in       the neighbourhood a stab with a bowie knife however at length       brought it to the ground and we dragged it into the ravine       congratulating ourselves that at all events we had thus       obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week        we now went out again to look about us and ventured a       considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill       but met with nothing else which could serve us for food we       therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned seeing       one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the       village laden with the plunder of the vessel and who we were       apprehensive might discover us in passing beneath the hill        our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as       possible and with this object we arranged some brushwood over       the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through       which we saw the patch of blue sky on reaching the platform from       the interior of the chasm we left only a very small opening just       wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay without the risk of       being discovered from below having done this we congratulated       ourselves upon the security of the position for we were now       completely excluded from observation as long as we chose to       remain within the ravine itself and not venture out upon the       hill we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been       within this hollow but indeed when we came to reflect upon the       probability that the fissure through which we attained it had       been only just now created by the fall of the cliff opposite and       that no other way of attaining it could be perceived we were not       so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation       as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for       descent we resolved to explore the summit of the hill       thoroughly when a good opportunity should offer in the meantime       we watched the motions of the savages through our loophole        they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel and were       now preparing to set her on fire in a little while we saw the       smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway and       shortly afterward a dense mass of flame burst up from the       forecastle the rigging masts and what remained of the sails       caught immediately and the fire spread rapidly along the decks       still a great many of the savages retained their stations about       her hammering with large stones axes and cannon balls at the       bolts and other iron and copper work on the beach and in canoes       and rafts there were not less altogether in the immediate       vicinity of the schooner than ten thousand natives besides the       shoals of them who laden with booty were making their way       inland and over to the neighbouring islands we now anticipated a       catastrophe and were not disappointed first of all there came a       smart shock which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we       had been slightly galvanized but unattended with any visible       signs of an explosion the savages were evidently startled and       paused for an instant from their labours and yellings they were       upon the point of recommencing when suddenly a mass of smoke       puffed up from the decks resembling a black and heavy       thundercloudthen as if from its bowels arose a tall stream of       vivid fire to the height apparently of a quarter of a milethen       there came a sudden circular expansion of the flamethen the       whole atmosphere was magically crowded in a single instant with       a wild chaos of wood and metal and human limbsand lastly       came the concussion in its fullest fury which hurled us       impetuously from our feet while the hills echoed and reechoed       the tumult and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the       ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us        the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation       and they had now indeed reaped the full and perfect fruits of       their treachery perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion       while at least an equal number were desperately mangled the       whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling       and drowning wretches and on shore matters were even worse they       seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of       their discomfiture and made no efforts at assisting one another       at length we observed a total change in their demeanour from       absolute stupor they appeared to be all at once aroused to the       highest pitch of excitement and rushed wildly about going to       and from a certain point on the beach with the strangest       expressions of mingled horror rage and intense curiosity       depicted on their countenances and shouting at the top of their       voices tekelili tekelili        presently we saw a large body go off into the hills whence they       returned in a short time carrying stakes of wood these they       brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest which       now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this       excitement we perceived something white lying upon the ground       but could not immediately make out what it was at length we saw       that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the scarlet       teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the       eighteenth of january captain guy had had the body preserved for       the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england i       remember he had given some directions about it just before our       making the island and it had been brought into the cabin and       stowed away in one of the lockers it had now been thrown on       shore by the explosion but why it had occasioned so much concern       among the savages was more than we could comprehend although       they crowded around the carcass at a little distance none of       them seemed willing to approach it closely byandby the men       with the stakes drove them in a circle around it and no sooner       was this arrangement completed than the whole of the vast       assemblage rushed into the interior of the island with loud       screams of tekelili tekelili     chapter          during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in       our hidingplace upon the hill going out only occasionally and       then with the greatest precaution for water and filberts we had       made a kind of penthouse on the platform furnishing it with a       bed of dry leaves and placing in it three large flat stones       which served us for both fireplace and table we kindled a fire       without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together       the one soft the other hard the bird we had taken in such good       season proved excellent eating although somewhat tough it was       not an oceanic fowl but a species of bittern with jet black and       grizzly plumage and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk       we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the       ravine apparently seeking for the one we had captured but as       they never alighted we had no opportunity of catching them        as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our       situation but it was now entirely consumed and it became       absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision the       filberts would not satisfy the cravings of hunger afflicting us       too with severe gripings of the bowels and if freely indulged       in with violent headache we had seen several large tortoises       near the seashore to the eastward of the hill and perceived they       might be easily taken if we could get at them without the       observation of the natives it was resolved therefore to make       an attempt at descending        we commenced by going down the southern declivity which seemed       to offer the fewest difficulties but had not proceeded a hundred       yards before as we had anticipated from appearances on the       hilltop our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the       gorge in which our companions had perished we now passed along       the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile when we were       again stopped by a precipice of immense depth and not being       able to make our way along the brink of it we were forced to       retrace our steps by the main ravine        we now pushed over to the eastward but with precisely similar       fortune after an hours scramble at the risk of breaking our       necks we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit       of black granite with fine dust at the bottom and whence the       only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down       toiling again up this path we now tried the northern edge of the       hill here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution       in our maneuvers as the least indiscretion would expose us to       the full view of the savages in the village we crawled along       therefore on our hands and knees and occasionally were even       forced to throw ourselves at full length dragging our bodies       along by means of the shrubbery in this careful manner we had       proceeded but a little way when we arrived at a chasm far deeper       than any we had yet seen and leading directly into the main       gorge thus our fears were fully confirmed and we found       ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below       thoroughly exhausted by our exertions we made the best of our       way back to the platform and throwing ourselves upon the bed of       leaves slept sweetly and soundly for some hours        for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in       exploring every part of the summit of the hill in order to       inform ourselves of its actual resources we found that it would       afford us no food with the exception of the unwholesome       filberts and a rank species of scurvy grass which grew in a       little patch of not more than four rods square and would be soon       exhausted on the fifteenth of february as near as i can       remember there was not a blade of this left and the nuts were       growing scarce our situation therefore could hardly be more       lamentable  on the sixteenth we again went round the walls       of our prison in hope of finding some avenue of escape but to       no purpose we also descended the chasm in which we had been       overwhelmed with the faint expectation of discovering through       this channel some opening to the main ravine here too we were       disappointed although we found and brought up with us a musket        on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining       more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made       our way in the first search we remembered that one of the       fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked       into and we were anxious to explore it although with no       expectation of discovering here any opening        we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow       as before and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some       attention it was indeed one of the most singularlooking       places imaginable and we could scarcely bring ourselves to       believe it altogether the work of nature the pit from its       eastern to its western extremity was about five hundred yards in       length when all its windings were threaded the distance from       east to west in a straight line not being more i should suppose       having no means of accurate examination than forty or fifty       yards upon first descending into the chasm that is to say for       a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill the sides of       the abyss bore little resemblance to each other and apparently       had at no time been connected the one surface being of the       soapstone and the other of marl granulated with some metallic       matter the average breadth or interval between the two cliffs       was probably here sixty feet but there seemed to be no       regularity of formation passing down however beyond the limit       spoken of the interval rapidly contracted and the sides began       to run parallel although for some distance farther they were       still dissimilar in their material and form of surface upon       arriving within fifty feet of the bottom a perfect regularity       commenced the sides were now entirely uniform in substance in       colour and in lateral direction the material being a very black       and shining granite and the distance between the two sides at       all points facing each other exactly twenty yards the precise       formation of the chasm will be best understood by means of a       delineation taken upon the spot for i had luckily with me a       pocketbook and pencil which i preserved with great care through       a long series of subsequent adventure and to which i am indebted       for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been       crowded from my remembrance        this figure no figures in text gives the general outlines of       the chasm without the minor cavities in the sides of which       there were several each cavity having a corresponding       protuberance opposite the bottom of the gulf was covered to the       depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable       beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite to       the right at the lower extremity will be noticed the appearance       of a small opening this is the fissure alluded to above and to       examine which more minutely than before was the object of our       second visit we now pushed into it with vigor cutting away a       quantity of brambles which impeded us and removing a vast heap       of sharp flints somewhat resembling arrowheads in shape we were       encouraged to persevere however by perceiving some little light       proceeding from the farther end we at length squeezed our way       for about thirty feet and found that the aperture was a low and       regularly formed arch having a bottom of the same impalpable       powder as that in the main chasm a strong light now broke upon       us and turning a short bend we found ourselves in another       lofty chamber similar to the one we had left in every respect       but longitudinal form its general figure is here given        the total length of this chasm commencing at the opening a and       proceeding round the curve b to the extremity d is five       hundred and fifty yards at c we discovered a small aperture       similar to the one through which we had issued from the other       chasm and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles       and a quantity of the white arrowhead flints we forced our way       through it finding it about forty feet long and emerged into a       third chasm this too was precisely like the first except in       its longitudinal shape which was thus        we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and       twenty yards at the point a was an opening about six feet       wide and extending fifteen feet into the rock where it       terminated in a bed of marl there being no other chasm beyond       as we had expected we were about leaving this fissure into       which very little light was admitted when peters called my       attention to a range of singularlooking indentures in the       surface of the marl forming the termination of the culdesac       with a very slight exertion of the imagination the left or most       northern of these indentures might have been taken for the       intentional although rude representation of a human figure       standing erect with outstretched arm the rest of them bore also       some little resemblance to alphabetical characters and peters       was willing at all events to adopt the idle opinion that they       were really such i convinced him of his error finally by       directing his attention to the floor of the fissure where among       the powder we picked up piece by piece several large flakes of       the marl which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion       from the surface where the indentures were found and which had       projecting points exactly fitting the indentures thus proving       them to have been the work of nature        after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded       us no means of escape from our prison we made our way back       dejected and dispirited to the summit of the hill nothing worth       mentioning occurred during the next twentyfour hours except       that in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm       we found two triangular holes of great depth and also with black       granite sides into these holes we did not think it worth while       to attempt descending as they had the appearance of mere natural       wells without outlet they were each about twenty yards in       circumference and their shape as well as relative position in       regard to the third chasm is shown in figure  image     chapter          on the twentieth of the month finding it altogether impossible       to subsist any longer upon the filberts the use of which       occasioned us the most excruciating torment we resolved to make       a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the       hill the face of the precipice was here of the softest species       of soapstone although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole       extent a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least and in       many places even overarching after a long search we discovered a       narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf upon       this peters contrived to leap with what assistance i could       render him by means of our pockethandkerchiefs tied together       with somewhat more difficulty i also got down and we then saw       the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in       which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried       by the fall of the hillthat is by cutting steps in the face of       the soapstone with our knives the extreme hazard of the attempt       can scarcely be conceived but as there was no other resource       we determined to undertake it        upon the ledge where we stood there grew some filbertbushes and       to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs       the other end being tied round peters waist i lowered him down       over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were       stretched tight he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the       soapstone as far in as eight or ten inches sloping away the       rock above to the height of a foot or thereabout so as to allow       of his driving with the butt of a pistol a tolerably strong peg       into the levelled surface i then drew him up for about four       feet when he made a hole similar to the one below driving in a       peg as before and having thus a restingplace for both feet and       hands i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush throwing       him the end which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole       letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower       than he had yet been that is to the full extent of the       handkerchiefs here he dug another hole and drove another peg       he then drew himself up so as to rest his feet in the hole just       cut taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above it       was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost       peg with the view of fastening them to the second and here he       found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so       great a distance apart however after one or two unsuccessful       and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot having to hold on       with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with       his right he at length cut the string leaving six inches of it       affixed to the peg tying the handkerchiefs now to the second       peg he descended to a station below the third taking care not       to go too far down by these means means which i should never       have conceived of myself and for which we were indebted       altogether to peters ingenuity and resolution my companion       finally succeeded with the occasional aid of projections in the       cliff in reaching the bottom without accident        it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to       follow him but i did at length attempt it peters had taken off       his shirt before descending and this with my own formed the       rope necessary for the adventure after throwing down the musket       found in the chasm i fastened this rope to the bushes and let       myself down rapidly striving by the vigor of my movements to       banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner       this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps       but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by       thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended and the       precarious nature of the pegs and soapstone holes which were my       only support it was in vain i endeavored to banish these       reflections and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat       surface of the cliff before me the more earnestly i struggled       not to thinkthe more intensely vivid became my conceptions       and the more horribly distinct at length arrived that crisis of       fancy so fearful in all similar cases the crisis in which we       began to anticipate the feelings with which we shallfallto       picture to ourselves the sickness and dizziness and the last       struggle and the half swoon and the final bitterness of the       rushing and headlong descent and now i found these fancies       creating their own realities and all imagined horrors crowding       upon me in fact i felt my knees strike violently together while       my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp       there was a ringing in my ears and i said this is my knell of       death and now i was consumed with the irrepressible desire of       looking below i could not i would not confine my glances to       the cliff and with a wild indefinable emotion half of horror       half of a relieved oppression i threw my vision far down into       the abyss for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon       their hold while with the movement the faintest possible idea       of ultimate escape wandered like a shadow through my mindin       the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall a       desire a yearning a passion utterly uncontrollable i let go at       once my grasp upon the peg and turning half round from the       precipice remained tottering for an instant against its naked       face but now there came a spinning of the brain a       shrillsounding and phantom voice screamed within my ears a       dusky fiendish and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me       and sighing i sunk down with a bursting heart and plunged       within its arms        i had swooned and peters had caught me as i fell he had       observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the       cliff and perceiving my imminent danger had endeavored to       inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise       although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my       hearing what he said or being conscious that he had even spoken       to me at all at length seeing me totter he hastened to ascend       to my rescue and arrived just in time for my preservation had i       fallen with my full weight the rope of linen would inevitably       have snapped and i should have been precipitated into the abyss       as it was he contrived to let me down gently so as to remain       suspended without danger until animation returned this was in       about fifteen minutes on recovery my trepidation had entirely       vanished i felt a new being and with some little further aid       from my companion reached the bottom also in safety        we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved       the tomb of our friends and to the southward of the spot where       the hill had fallen the place was one of singular wildness and       its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by       travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded       babylon not to speak of the ruins of the disrupted cliff which       formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward the       surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with       huge tumuli apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of       art although in detail no semblance of art could be detected       scoria were abundant and large shapeless blocks of the black       granite intermingled with others of marl  and both       granulated with metal of vegetation there were no traces       whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within       sight several immense scorpions were seen and various reptiles       not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes as food was our       most immediate object we resolved to make our way to the       seacoast distant not more than half a mile with a view of       catching turtle several of which we had observed from our place       of concealment on the hill we had proceeded some hundred yards       threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and tumuli       when upon turning a corner five savages sprung upon us from a       small cavern felling peters to the ground with a blow from a       club as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their       victim leaving me time to recover from my astonishment i still       had the musket but the barrel had received so much injury in       being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless       preferring to trust my pistols which had been carefully       preserved in order with these i advanced upon the assailants       firing one after the other in quick succession two savages fell       and one who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters       sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose my       companion being thus released we had no further difficulty he       had his pistols also but prudently declined using them       confiding in his great personal strength which far exceeded that       of any person i have ever known seizing a club from one of the       savages who had fallen he dashed out the brains of the three who       remained killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the       weapon and leaving us completely masters of the field        so rapidly had these events passed that we could scarcely       believe in their reality and were standing over the bodies of       the dead in a species of stupid contemplation when we were       brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance       it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing and       that we had little chance of avoiding discovery to regain the       cliff it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the       shouts and even should we succeed in arriving at its base we       should never be able to ascend it without being seen our       situation was one of the greatest peril and we were hesitating       in which path to commence a flight when one of the savages       whomi had shot and supposed dead sprang briskly to his feet       and attempted to make his escape we overtook himhowever       before he had advanced many paces and were about to put him to       death when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit       from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape we       therefore dragged him with us making him understand that we       would shoot him if he offered resistance in a few minutes he was       perfectly submissive and ran by our sides as we pushed in among       the rocks making for the seashore        so far the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing       hid the sea except at intervals from our sight and when we       first had it fairly in view it was perhaps two hundred yards       distant as we emerged into the open beach we saw to our great       dismay an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village       and from all visible quarters of the island making toward us       with gesticulations of extreme fury and howling like wild       beasts we were upon the point of turning upon our steps and       trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher       ground when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from       behind a large rock which ran out into the water toward these we       now ran with all speed and reaching them found them unguarded       and without any other freight than three of the large gallipago       turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers we       instantly took possession of one of them and forcing our       captive on board pushed out to sea with all the strength we       could command        we had not made however more than fifty yards from the shore       before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great       oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe       in the power of the savages who by this time were not more       than twice as far from the beach as ourselves and were rapidly       advancing to the pursuit no time was now to be lost our hope       was at best a forlorn one but we had none other it was very       doubtful whether with the utmost exertion we could get back in       time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe but       yet there was a chance that we could we might save ourselves if       we succeeded while not to make the attempt was to resign       ourselves to inevitable butchery        the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike and in       place of turning it around we merely changed our position in       paddling as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled       their yells as well as their speed and approached with       inconceivable rapidity we pulled however with all the energy       of desperation and arrived at the contested point before more       than one of the natives had attained it this man paid dearly for       his superior agility peters shooting him through the head with a       pistol as he approached the shore the foremost among the rest of       his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we       seized upon the canoe we at first endeavored to pull her into       the deep water beyond the reach of the savages but finding her       too firmly aground and there being no time to spare peters       with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket       succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one       side we then pushed off two of the natives by this time had got       hold of our boat obstinately refusing to let go until we were       forced to despatch them with our knives we were now clear off       and making great way out to sea the main body of the savages       upon reaching the broken canoe set up the most tremendous yell       of rage and disappointment conceivable in truth from everything       i could see of these wretches they appeared to be the most       wicked hypocritical vindictive bloodthirsty and altogether       fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe it is clear we       should have had no mercy had we fallen into their hands they       made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe but       finding it useless again vented their rage in a series of       hideous vociferations and rushed up into the hills        we were thus relieved from immediate danger but our situation       was still sufficiently gloomy we knew that four canoes of the       kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages       and were not aware of the fact afterward ascertained from our       captive that two of these had been blown to pieces in the       explosion of the jane guywe calculated therefore upon being       yet pursued as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay       distant about three miles where the boats were usually laid up       fearing this we made every exertion to leave the island behind       us and went rapidly through the water forcing the prisoner to       take a paddle in about half an hour when we had gained probably       five or six miles to the southward a large fleet of the       flatbottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay       evidently with the design of pursuit presently they put back       despairing to overtake us     chapter          we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean       in a latitude exceeding eightyfour degrees in a frail canoe       and with no provision but the three turtles the long polar       winter too could not be considered as far distant and it       became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course       to be pursued there were six or seven islands in sight belonging       to the same group and distant from each other about five or six       leagues but upon neither of these had we any intention to       venture in coming from the northward in the jane guy we had       been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of       icethis however little it maybe in accordance with the       generally received notions respecting the antarctic was a       factexperience would not permit us to deny to attempt       therefore getting back would be follyespecially at so late a       period of the season only one course seemed to be left open for       hope we resolved to steer boldly to the southward where there       was at least a probability of discovering other lands and more       than a probability of finding a still milder climate        so far we had found the antarctic like the arctic ocean       peculiarly free from violent storms or immoderately rough water       but our canoe was at best of frail structure although large       and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as       the limited means in our possession would admit the body of the       boat was of no better material than barkthe bark of a tree       unknown the ribs were of a tough osier well adapted to the       purpose for which it was used we had fifty feet room from stem       to stern from four to six in breadth and in depth throughout       four feet and a halfthe boats thus differing vastly in shape       from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with       whom civilized nations are acquainted we never did believe them       the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them and       some days after this period discovered by questioning our       captive that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to       the southwest of the country where we found them having fallen       accidentally into the hands of our barbarians what we could do       for the security of our boat was very little indeed several wide       rents were discovered near both ends and these we contrived to       patch up with pieces of woollen jacket with the help of the       superfluous paddles of which there were a great many we erected       a kind of framework about the bow so as to break the force of       any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter we also       set up two paddleblades for masts placing them opposite each       other one by each gunwale thus saving the necessity of a yard       to these masts we attached a sail made of our shirtsdoing this       with some difficulty as here we could get no assistance from our       prisoner whatever although he had been willing enough to labor       in all the other operations the sight of the linen seemed to       affect him in a very singular manner he could not be prevailed       upon to touch it or go near it shuddering when we attempted to       force him and shrieking out tekelili        having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of       the canoe we now set sail to the southsoutheast for the       present with the view of weathering the most southerly of the       group in sight this being done we turned the bow full to the       southward the weather could by no means be considered       disagreeable we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the       northward a smooth sea and continual daylight no ice whatever       was to be seen nor did i ever see one particle of this after       leaving the parallel of bennets isletindeed the temperature       of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any       quantity having killed the largest of our tortoises and       obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water we       continued on our course without any incident of moment for       perhaps seven or eight days during which period we must have       proceeded a vast distance to the southward as the wind blew       constantly with us and a very strong current set continually in       the direction we were pursuing        march st many unusual phenomena nowindicated that we       were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder a high range       of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon       flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks now darting from east       to west now from west to east and again presenting a level and       uniform summitin short having all the wild variations of the       aurora borealis the average height of this vapor as apparent       from our station was about twentyfive degrees the temperature       of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily and there was a       very perceptible alteration in its color        march dtoday by repeated questioning of our captive we       came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island       of the massacre its inhabitants and customsbut with these how       can i now detain the reader i may say however that we learned       there were eight islands in the groupthat they were governed by       a common king named tsalemonor psalemounwho resided in one       of the smallest of the islands that the black skins forming the       dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be       found only in a valley near the court of the kingthat the       inhabitants of the group fabricated no other boats than the       flatbottomed rafts the four canoes being all of the kind in       their possession and these having been obtained by mere       accident from some large island in the southwestthat his own       name was nunuthat he had no knowledge of bennets isletand       that the appellation of the island he had left was tsalal the       commencement of the words tsalemonand tsalal was given with a       prolonged hissing sound which we found it impossible to imitate       even after repeated endeavors and which was precisely the same       with the note of the black bittern we had eaten up on the summit       of the hill        march dthe heat of the water was now truly remarkable and       in color was undergoing a rapid change being no longer       transparent but of a milky consistency and hue in our immediate       vicinity it was usually smooth never so rough as to endanger the       canoebut we were frequently surprised at perceiving to our       right and left at different distances sudden and extensive       agitations of the surface these we at length noticed were       always preceded by wild flickerings in the region of vapor to the       southward        march thtoday with the view of widening our sail the       breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly i took from my       coatpocket a white handkerchief nunu was seated at my elbow       and the linen accidentally flaring in his face he became       violently affected with convulsions these were succeeded by       drowsiness and stupor and low murmurings of tekelili       tekelili        marchththe wind had entirely ceased but it was evident that       we were still hurrying on to the southward under the influence       of a powerful current and nowindeed it would seem reasonable       that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were       takingbut we felt none the countenance of peters indicated       nothing of this nature although it wore at times an expression i       could not fathom the polar winter appeared to be coming onbut       coming without its terrors i felt a numbness of body and minda       dreaminess of sensation but this was all        march ththe gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees       above the horizon and was gradually losing its grayness of tint       the heat of the water was extreme even unpleasant to the touch       and its milky hue was more evident than ever today a violent       agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe it was       attended as usual with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its       summit and a momentary division at its base a fine white       powder resembling ashesbut certainly not suchfell over the       canoe and over a large surface of the water as the flickering       died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea       nunu now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat       and no persuasions could induce him to arise        march ththis day we questioned nunu concerning the motives       of his countrymen in destroying our companions but he appeared       to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational       reply he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat and       upon reiterating the questions as to the motive made use only of       idiotic gesticulations such as raising with his forefinger the       upper lip and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it these       were black we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant       of tsalal        march thtoday there floated by us one of the white animals       whose appearance upon the beach at tsalal had occasioned so wild       a commotion among the savages i would have picked it up but       there came over me a sudden listlessness and i forbore the heat       of the water still increased and the hand could no longer be       endured within it peters spoke little and i knew not what to       think of his apathy nunu breathed and no more        march ththe whole ashy material fell now continually around       us and in vast quantities the range of vapor to the southward       had arisen prodigiously in the horizon and began to assume more       distinctness of form i can liken it to nothing but a limitless       cataract rolling silently into the sea from some immense and       fardistant rampart in the heaven the gigantic curtain ranged       along the whole extent of the southern horizon it emitted no       sound        march sta sullen darkness now hovered above usbut from out       the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose and stole       up along the bulwarks of the boat we were nearly overwhelmed by       the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe       but melted into the water as it fell the summit of the cataract       was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance yet we were       evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity at intervals       there were visible in it wide yawning but momentary rents and       from out these rents within which was a chaos of flitting and       indistinct images there came rushing and mighty but soundless       winds tearing up the enkindled ocean in their course        march dthe darkness had materially increased relieved only       by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain       before us many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew       continuously now from beyond the veil and their scream was the       eternal tekelilias they retreated from our vision hereupon       nunu stirred in the bottom of the boat but upon touching him we       found his spirit departed and now we rushed into the embraces of       the cataract where a chasm threw itself open to receive us but       there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure very far       larger in its proportions than any dweller among men and the hue       of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the       snow        note        the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing       death of mr pym are already well known to the public through the       medium of the daily press it is feared that the few remaining       chapters which were to have completed his narrative and which       were retained by him while the above were in type for the       purpose of revision have been irrecoverably lost through the       accident by which he perished himself this however may prove       not to be the case and the papers if ultimately found will be       given to the public        no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency the       gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface and who from       the statement there made might be supposed able to fill the       vacuum has declined the taskthis for satisfactory reasons       connected with the general inaccuracy of the details afforded       him and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions       of the narration peters from whom some information might be       expected is still alive and a resident of illinois but cannot       be met with at present he may hereafter be found and will no       doubt afford material for a conclusion of mr pyms account        the loss of two or three final chapters for there were but two       or three is the more deeply to be regretted as it can not be       doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself or at       least to regions in its very near proximity and as too the       statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly       be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental       expedition now preparing for the southern ocean        on one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered       and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if       what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit       in any degree upon the very singular pages now published we       allude to the chasms found in the island of tsalal and to the       whole of the figures upon pages  of the printed       editioned        note no figures were included with this text        mr pym has given the figures of the chasms without comment and       speaks decidedly of the indenturesfound at the extremity of the       most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful       resemblance to alphabetical characters and in short as being       positively not such this assertion is made in a manner so       simple and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive       viz the fitting of the projections of the fragments found       among the dust into the indentures upon the wall that we are       forced to believe the writer in earnest and no reasonable reader       should suppose otherwise but as the facts in relation to all the       figures are most singular especially when taken in connection       with statements made in the body of the narrative it may be as       well to say a word or two concerning them allthis too the more       especially as the facts in question have beyond doubt escaped       the attention of mr poe        figure  then figure  figure  and figure  when conjoined       with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves       presented and when deprived of the small lateral branches or       arches which it will be remembered served only as a means of       communication between the main chambers and were of totally       distinct character constitute an ethiopian verbal rootthe root       to be shadywhence all the inflections of shadow or darkness        in regard to the left or most northwardly of the indentures in       figure  it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was       correct and that the hieroglyphical appearance was really the       work of art and intended as the representation of a human form       the delineation is before the reader and he may or may not       perceive the resemblance suggested but the rest of the       indentures afford strong confirmation of peters idea the upper       range is evidently the arabic verbal root to be white whence       all the inflections of brilliancy and whiteness the lower range       is not so immediately perspicuous the characters are somewhat       broken and disjointed nevertheless it can not be doubted that       in their perfect state they formed the full egyptian word the       region of the south it should be observed that these       interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the       most northwardly of the figures the arm is outstretched toward       the south        conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and       exciting conjecture they should be regarded perhaps in       connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of       the narrative although in no visible manner is this chain of       connection complete tekelili was the cry of the affrighted       natives of tsalal upon discovering the carcase of the       whiteanimal picked up at sea this also was the shuddering       exclamatives of tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the       whitematerials in possession of mr pym this also was the       shriek of the swiftflying white and gigantic birds which       issued from the vapory whitecurtain of the south nothing       whitewas to be found at tsalal and nothing otherwise in the       subsequent voyage to the region beyond it is not impossible that       tsalal the appellation of the island of the chasms may be       found upon minute philological scrutiny to betray either some       alliance with the chasms themselves or some reference to the       ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings        i have graven it within the hills and my vengeance upon the       dust within the rock     notes to the third volume          whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron oiltankswhy       the grampus was not i have never been able to ascertain         the case of the brig polly of boston is one so much in       point and her fate in many respects so remarkably similar to       our own that i cannot forbear alluding to it here this vessel       of one hundred and thirty tons burden sailed from boston with a       cargo of lumber and provisions for santa croix on the twelfth       of december  under the command of captain casneau there       were eight souls on board besides the captainthe mate four       seamen and the cook together with a mr hunt and a negro girl       belonging to him on the fifteenth having cleared the shoal of       georges she sprung a leak in a gale of wind from the southeast       and was finally capsized but the masts going by the board she       afterward righted they remained in this situation without fire       and with very little provision for the period of one hundred and       ninetyone days from december the fifteenth to june the       twentieth when captain casneau and samuel badger the only       survivors were taken off the wreck by the fame of hull captain       featherstone bound home from rio janeiro when picked up they       were in latitude  degrees n longitude  degrees w having       drifted above two thousand miles on the ninth of july the fame       fell in with the brig dromero captain perkins who landed the       two sufferers in kennebeck the narrative from which we gather       these details ends in the following words        it is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast       distance upon the most frequented part of the atlantic and not       be discovered all this time they were passed by more than a       dozen sail one of which came so nigh them that they could       distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at       them but to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving       and freezing men they stifled the dictates of compassion       hoisted sail and cruelly abandoned them to their fate         among the vessels which at various times have professed to       meet with the auroras may be mentioned the ship san miguel in        the ship aurora in  the brig pearl in  and the       ship dolores in  they all agree in giving the mean latitude       fiftythree degrees south         the terms morning and evening which i have made use of to       avoid confusion in my narrative as far as possible must not of       course be taken in their ordinary sense for a long time past we       had had no night at all the daylight being continual the dates       throughout are according to nautical time and the bearing must       be understood as per compass i would also remark in this place       that i cannot in the first portion of what is here written       pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates or latitudes and       longitudes having kept no regular journal until after the period       of which this first portion treats in many instances i have       relied altogether upon memory         this day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the       south several huge wreaths of the grayish vapour i have spoken       of         the marl was also black indeed we noticed no light colored       substances of any kind upon the island        for obvious reasons i cannot pretend to strict accuracy in       these dates they are given principally with a view to perspicity       of narrative and as set down in my pencil memorandum     ligeia         and the will therein lieth which dieth not who knoweth the       mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is but a great       will pervading all things by nature of its intentness man doth       not yield himself to the angels nor unto death utterly save       only through the weakness of his feeble willjoseph glanvill        i cannot for my soul remember how when or even precisely       where i first became acquainted with the lady ligeia long years       have since elapsed and my memory is feeble through much       suffering or perhaps i cannot now bring these points to mind       because in truth the character of my beloved her rare       learning her singular yet placid cast of beauty and the       thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical language       made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily       progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown yet i       believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large       old decaying city near the rhine of her familyi have surely       heard her speak that it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be       doubted ligeia ligeia buried in studies of a nature more than       all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world it       is by that sweet word aloneby ligeiathat i bring before mine       eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more and now while i       write a recollection flashes upon me that i have never known the       paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed and who       became the partner of my studies and finally the wife of my       bosom was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia or was       it a test of my strength of affection that i should institute no       inquiries upon this point or was it rather a caprice of my owna       wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate       devotion i but indistinctly recall the fact itselfwhat wonder       that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated       or attended it and indeed if ever that spirit which is       entitled romanceif ever she the wan and the mistywinged       ashtophet of idolatrous egypt presided as they tell over       marriages illomened then most surely she presided over mine        there is one dear topic however on which my memory fails me       not it is the person of ligeia in stature she was tall       somewhat slender and in her latter days even emaciated i       would in vain attempt to portray the majesty the quiet ease of       her demeanor or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of       her footfall she came and departed as a shadow i was never made       aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music       of her low sweet voice as she placed her marble hand upon my       shoulder in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her it was       the radiance of an opiumdreaman airy and spiritlifting vision       more wildly divine than the phantasies which hovered about the       slumbering souls of the daughters of delos yet her features were       not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to       worship in the classical labors of the heathen there is no       exquisite beauty says bacon lord verulam speaking truly of       all the forms and genera of beauty without some strangeness in       the proportion yet although i saw that the features of ligeia       were not of a classic regularityalthough i perceived that her       loveliness was indeed exquisite and felt that there was much       of strangeness pervading it yet i have tried in vain to detect       the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of the       strange i examined the contour of the lofty and pale       foreheadit was faultlesshow cold indeed that word when applied       to a majesty so divinethe skin rivalling the purest ivory the       commanding extent and repose the gentle prominence of the       regions above the temples and then the ravenblack the glossy       the luxuriant and naturallycurling tresses setting forth the       full force of the homeric epithet hyacinthine i looked at the       delicate outlines of the noseand nowhere but in the graceful       medallions of the hebrews had i beheld a similar perfection       there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface the same       scarcely perceptible tendency to the aquiline the same       harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit i regarded       the sweet mouth here was indeed the triumph of all things       heavenlythe magnificent turn of the short upper lipthe soft       voluptuous slumber of the underthe dimples which sported and       the color which spokethe teeth glancing back with a brilliancy       almost startling every ray of the holy light which fell upon       them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of all       smiles i scrutinized the formation of the chinand here too i       found the gentleness of breadth the softness and the majesty       the fullness and the spirituality of the greekthe contour which       the god apollo revealed but in a dream to cleomenes the son of       the athenian and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia        for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique it might have       been too that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to       which lord verulam alludes they were i must believe far larger       than the ordinary eyes of our own race they were even fuller       than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the valley       of nourjahad yet it was only at intervalsin moments of intense       excitementthat this peculiarity became more than slightly       noticeable in ligeia and at such moments was her beautyin my       heated fancy thus it appeared perhapsthe beauty of beings either       above or apart from the earththe beauty of the fabulous houri of       the turk the hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black       and far over them hung jetty lashes of great length the brows       slightly irregular in outline had the same tint the       strangeness however which i found in the eyes was of a       nature distinct from the formation or the color or the       brilliancy of the features and must after all be referred to       the expression ah word of no meaning behind whose vast       latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so much of       the spiritual the expression of the eyes of ligeia how for long       hours have i pondered upon it how have i through the whole of a       midsummer night struggled to fathom it what was itthat       something more profound than the well of democrituswhich lay far       within the pupils of my beloved what was it i was possessed       with a passion to discover those eyes those large those       shining those divine orbs they became to me twin stars of leda       and i to them devoutest of astrologers        there is no point among the many incomprehensible anomalies of       the science of mind more thrillingly exciting than the       factnever i believe noticed in the schoolsthat in our       endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten we often       find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being       able in the end to remember and thus how frequently in my       intense scrutiny of ligeias eyes have i felt approaching the       full knowledge of their expressionfelt it approachingyet not       quite be mineand so at length entirely depart and strange oh       strangest mystery of all i found in the commonest objects of       the universe a circle of analogies to that expression i mean to       say that subsequently to the period when ligeias beauty passed       into my spirit there dwelling as in a shrine i derived from       many existences in the material world a sentiment such as i felt       always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs yet not       the more could i define that sentiment or analyze or even       steadily view it i recognized it let me repeat sometimes in       the survey of a rapidlygrowing vinein the contemplation of a       moth a butterfly a chrysalis a stream of running water i have       felt it in the oceanin the falling of a meteor i have felt it       in the glances of unusually aged people and there are one or two       stars in heavenone especially a star of the sixth magnitude       double and changeable to be found near the large star in lyra       in a telescopic scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the       feeling i have been filled with it by certain sounds from       stringed instruments and not unfrequently by passages from       books among innumerable other instances i well remember       something in a volume of joseph glanvill which perhaps merely       from its quaintnesswho shall say never failed to inspire me       with the sentiment and the will therein lieth which dieth not       who knoweth the mysteries of the will with its vigor for god is       but a great will pervading all things by nature of its       intentness man doth not yield him to the angels nor unto death       utterly save only through the weakness of his feeble will        length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to       trace indeed some remote connection between this passage in the       english moralist and a portion of the character of ligeia an       intensity in thought action or speech was possibly in her a       result or at least an index of that gigantic volition which       during our long intercourse failed to give other and more       immediate evidence of its existence of all the women whom i have       ever known she the outwardly calm the everplacid ligeia was       the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern       passion and of such passion i could form no estimate save by       the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted       and appalled meby the almost magical melody modulation       distinctness and placidity of her very low voiceand by the       fierce energy rendered doubly effective by contrast with her       manner of utterance of the wild words which she habitually       uttered        i have spoken of the learning of ligeia it was immensesuch as i       have never known in woman in the classical tongues was she       deeply proficient and as far as my own acquaintance extended in       regard to the modern dialects of europe i have never known her       at fault indeed upon any theme of the most admired because       simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy       have i ever found ligeia at fault how singularlyhow       thrillingly this one point in the nature of my wife has forced       itself at this late period only upon my attention i said her       knowledge was such as i have never known in womanbut where       breathes the man who has traversed and successfully all the       wide areas of moral physical and mathematical science i saw       not then what i now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of       ligeia were gigantic were astounding yet i was sufficiently       aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself with a       childlike confidence to her guidance through the chaotic world       of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied       during the earlier years of our marriage with how vast a       triumphwith how vivid a delightwith how much of all that is       ethereal in hope did i feel as she bent over me in studies but       little soughtbut less knownthat delicious vista by slow degrees       expanding before me down whose long gorgeous and all untrodden       path i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too       divinely precious not to be forbidden        how poignant then must have been the grief with which after       some years i beheld my wellgrounded expectations take wings to       themselves and fly away without ligeia i was but as a child       groping benighted her presence her readings alone rendered       vividly luminous the many mysteries of the transcendentalism in       which we were immersed wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes       letters lambent and golden grew duller than saturnian lead and       now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over       which i pored ligeia grew ill the wild eyes blazed with a       tootoo glorious effulgence the pale fingers became of the       transparent waxen hue of the grave and the blue veins upon the       lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the       gentle emotion i saw that she must dieand i struggled       desperately in spirit with the grim azrael and the struggles of       the passionate wife were to my astonishment even more energetic       than my own there had been much in her stern nature to impress       me with the belief that to her death would have come without       its terrors but not so words are impotent to convey any just       idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with       the shadow i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle i       would have soothedi would have reasoned but in the intensity       of her wild desire for lifefor lifebut for lifesolace and       reason were the uttermost folly yet not until the last instance       amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce spirit was       shaken the external placidity of her demeanor her voice grew       more gentlegrew more lowyet i would not wish to dwell upon the       wild meaning of the quietly uttered words my brain reeled as i       hearkened entranced to a melody more than mortalto assumptions       and aspirations which mortality had never before known        that she loved me i should not have doubted and i might have       been easily aware that in a bosom such as hers love would have       reigned no ordinary passion but in death only was i fully       impressed with the strength of her affection for long hours       detaining my hand would she pour out before me the overflowing       of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to       idolatry how had i deserved to be so blessed by such       confessionshow had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal       of my beloved in the hour of her making them but upon this       subject i cannot bear to dilate let me say only that in       ligeias more than womanly abandonment to a love alas all       unmerited all unworthily bestowed i at length recognized the       principle of her longing with so wildly earnest a desire for the       life which was now fleeing so rapidly away it is this wild       longingit is this eager vehemence of desire for lifebut for       lifethat i have no power to portrayno utterance capable of       expressing        at high noon of the night in which she departed beckoning me       peremptorily to her side she bade me repeat certain verses       composed by herself not many days before i obeyed her they were       these  lo tis a gala night     within the lonesome latter years an angel throng bewinged bedight     in veils and drowned in tears sit in a theatre to see     a play of hopes and fears while the orchestra breathes fitfully     the music of the spheres  mimes in the form of god on high     mutter and mumble low and hither and thither fly     mere puppets they who come and go at bidding of vast formless things     that shift the scenery to and fro flapping from out their condor wings     invisible wo  that motley dramaoh be sure     it shall not be forgot with its phantom chased forever more     by a crowd that seize it not through a circle that ever returneth in     to the selfsame spot and much of madness and more of sin     and horror the soul of the plot  but see amid the mimic rout     a crawling shape intrude a bloodred thing that writhes from out     the scenic solitude it writhesit writheswith mortal pangs     the mimes become its food and the seraphs sob at vermin fangs     in human gore imbued  outout are the lightsout all     and over each quivering form the curtain a funeral pall     comes down with the rush of a storm and the angels all pallid and wan     uprising unveiling affirm that the play is the tragedy man     and its hero the conqueror worm        o god half shrieked ligeia leaping to her feet and extending       her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement as i made an end of       these lineso god o divine fathershall these things be       undeviatingly soshall this conqueror be not once conquered are       we not part and parcel in thee whowho knoweth the mysteries of       the will with its vigor man doth not yield him to the angels       nor unto death utterly save only through the weakness of his       feeble will        and now as if exhausted with emotion she suffered her white       arms to fall and returned solemnly to her bed of death and as       she breathed her last sighs there came mingled with them a low       murmur from her lips i bent to them my ear and distinguished       again the concluding words of the passage in glanvillman doth       not yield him to the angels nor unto death utterly save only       through the weakness of his feeble will        she died and i crushed into the very dust with sorrow could no       longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and       decaying city by the rhine i had no lack of what the world calls       wealth ligeia had brought me far more very far more than       ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals after a few months       therefore of weary and aimless wandering i purchased and put       in some repair an abbey which i shall not name in one of the       wildest and least frequented portions of fair england the gloomy       and dreary grandeur of the building the almost savage aspect of       the domain the many melancholy and timehonored memories       connected with both had much in unison with the feelings of       utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and       unsocial region of the country yet although the external abbey       with its verdant decay hanging about it suffered but little       alteration i gave way with a childlike perversity and       perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my sorrows to a       display of more than regal magnificence within for such follies       even in childhood i had imbibed a taste and now they came back       to me as if in the dotage of grief alas i feel how much even of       incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and       fantastic draperies in the solemn carvings of egypt in the wild       cornices and furniture in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of       tufted gold i had become a bounden slave in the trammels of       opium and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my       dreams but these absurdities i must not pause to detail let me       speak only of that one chamber ever accursed whither in a       moment of mental alienation i led from the altar as my brideas       the successor of the unforgotten ligeiathe fairhaired and       blueeyed lady rowena trevanion of tremaine        there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration       of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me where       were the souls of the haughty family of the bride when through       thirst of gold they permitted to pass the threshold of an       apartment so bedecked a maiden and a daughter so beloved i have       said that i minutely remember the details of the chamberyet i am       sadly forgetful on topics of deep momentand here there was no       system no keeping in the fantastic display to take hold upon       the memory the room lay in a high turret of the castellated       abbey was pentagonal in shape and of capacious size occupying       the whole southern face of the pentagon was the sole windowan       immense sheet of unbroken glass from venicea single pane and       tinted of a leaden hue so that the rays of either the sun or       moon passing through it fell with a ghastly lustre on the       objects within over the upper portion of this huge window       extended the trellicework of an aged vine which clambered up       the massy walls of the turret the ceiling of gloomylooking       oak was excessively lofty vaulted and elaborately fretted with       the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semigothic       semidruidical device from out the most central recess of this       melancholy vaulting depended by a single chain of gold with       long links a huge censer of the same metal saracenic in       pattern and with many perforations so contrived that there       writhed in and out of them as if endued with a serpent vitality       a continual succession of particolored fires        some few ottomans and golden candelabra of eastern figure were       in various stations aboutand there was the couch toobridal       couchof an indian model and low and sculptured of solid ebony       with a palllike canopy above in each of the angles of the       chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite       from the tombs of the kings over against luxor with their aged       lids full of immemorial sculpture but in the draping of the       apartment lay alas the chief phantasy of all the lofty walls       gigantic in heighteven unproportionably sowere hung from summit       to foot in vast folds with a heavy and massivelooking       tapestrytapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet       on the floor as a covering for the ottomans and the ebony bed       as a canopy for the bed and as the gorgeous volutes of the       curtains which partially shaded the window the material was the       richest cloth of gold it was spotted all over at irregular       intervals with arabesque figures about a foot in diameter and       wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most jetty black but       these figures partook of the true character of the arabesque only       when regarded from a single point of view by a contrivance now       common and indeed traceable to a very remote period of       antiquity they were made changeable in aspect to one entering       the room they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities but       upon a farther advance this appearance gradually departed and       step by step as the visitor moved his station in the chamber he       saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly       forms which belong to the superstition of the norman or arise in       the guilty slumbers of the monk the phantasmagoric effect was       vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong       continual current of wind behind the draperiesgiving a hideous       and uneasy animation to the whole        in halls such as thesein a bridal chamber such as thisi passed       with the lady of tremaine the unhallowed hours of the first       month of our marriagepassed them with but little disquietude       that my wife dreaded the fierce moodiness of my temperthat she       shunned me and loved me but littlei could not help perceiving       but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise i loathed her with       a hatred belonging more to demon than to man my memory flew       back oh with what intensity of regret to ligeia the       beloved the august the beautiful the entombed i revelled in       recollections of her purity of her wisdom of her lofty her       ethereal nature of her passionate her idolatrous love now       then did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the       fires of her own in the excitement of my opium dreams for i was       habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug i would call       aloud upon her name during the silence of the night or among       the sheltered recesses of the glens by day as if through the       wild eagerness the solemn passion the consuming ardor of my       longing for the departed i could restore her to the pathway she       had abandonedah could it be foreverupon the earth        about the commencement of the second month of the marriage the       lady rowena was attacked with sudden illness from which her       recovery was slow the fever which consumed her rendered her       nights uneasy and in her perturbed state of halfslumber she       spoke of sounds and of motions in and about the chamber of the       turret which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of       her fancy or perhaps in the phantasmagoric influences of the       chamber itself she became at length convalescentfinally well       yet but a brief period elapsed ere a second more violent       disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering and from this       attack her frame at all times feeble never altogether       recovered her illnesses were after this epoch of alarming       character and of more alarming recurrence defying alike the       knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians with the       increase of the chronic disease which had thus apparently taken       too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by human       means i could not fail to observe a similar increase in the       nervous irritation of her temperament and in her excitability by       trivial causes of fear she spoke again and now more frequently       and pertinaciously of the soundsof the slight soundsand of the       unusual motions among the tapestries to which she had formerly       alluded        one night near the closing in of september she pressed this       distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my       attention she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber and i       had been watching with feelings half of anxiety half of vague       terror the workings of her emaciated countenance i sat by the       side of her ebony bed upon one of the ottomans of india she       partly arose and spoke in an earnest low whisper of sounds       which she then heard but which i could not hearof motions which       she then saw but which i could not perceive the wind was       rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries and i wished to show her       what let me confess it i could not all believe that those       almost inarticulate breathings and those very gentle variations       of the figures upon the wall were but the natural effects of       that customary rushing of the wind but a deadly pallor       overspreading her face had proved to me that my exertions to       reassure her would be fruitless she appeared to be fainting and       no attendants were within call i remembered where was deposited       a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by her       physicians and hastened across the chamber to procure it but       as i stepped beneath the light of the censer two circumstances       of a startling nature attracted my attention i had felt that       some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my       person and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet in the       very middle of the rich lustre thrown from the censer a shadowa       faint indefinite shadow of angelic aspectsuch as might be       fancied for the shadow of a shade but i was wild with the       excitement of an immoderate dose of opium and heeded these       things but little nor spoke of them to rowena having found the       wine i recrossed the chamber and poured out a gobletful which       i held to the lips of the fainting lady she had now partially       recovered however and took the vessel herself while i sank       upon an ottoman near me with my eyes fastened upon her person       it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall       upon the carpet and near the couch and in a second thereafter       as rowena was in the act of raising the wine to her lips i saw       or may have dreamed that i saw fall within the goblet as if       from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room three       or four large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid if       this i sawnot so rowena she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly       and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must after       all i considered have been but the suggestion of a vivid       imagination rendered morbidly active by the terror of the lady       by the opium and by the hour        yet i cannot conceal it from my own perception that immediately       subsequent to the fall of the rubydrops a rapid change for the       worse took place in the disorder of my wife so that on the       third subsequent night the hands of her menials prepared her for       the tomb and on the fourth i sat alone with her shrouded body       in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my bride       wild visions opiumengendered flitted shadowlike before me       i gazed with unquiet eye upon the sarcophagi in the angles of the       room upon the varying figures of the drapery and upon the       writhing of the particolored fires in the censer overhead my       eyes then fell as i called to mind the circumstances of a former       night to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had       seen the faint traces of the shadow it was there however no       longer and breathing with greater freedom i turned my glances       to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed then rushed upon me       a thousand memories of ligeiaand then came back upon my heart       with the turbulent violence of a flood the whole of that       unutterable woe with which i had regarded her thus enshrouded       the night waned and still with a bosom full of bitter thoughts       of the one only and supremely beloved i remained gazing upon the       body of rowena        it might have been midnight or perhaps earlier or later for i       had taken no note of time when a sob low gentle but very       distinct startled me from my revery i felt that it came from       the bed of ebonythe bed of death i listened in an agony of       superstitious terrorbut there was no repetition of the sound i       strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpsebut there       was not the slightest perceptible yet i could not have been       deceived i had heard the noise however faint and my soul was       awakened within me i resolutely and perseveringly kept my       attention riveted upon the body many minutes elapsed before any       circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery at       length it became evident that a slight a very feeble and barely       noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks and       along the sunken small veins of the eyelids through a species of       unutterable horror and awe for which the language of mortality       has no sufficiently energetic expression i felt my heart cease       to beat my limbs grow rigid where i sat yet a sense of duty       finally operated to restore my selfpossession i could no longer       doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparationsthat       rowena still lived it was necessary that some immediate exertion       be made yet the turret was altogether apart from the portion of       the abbey tenanted by the servantsthere were none within calli       had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room       for many minutesand this i could not venture to do i therefore       struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill       hovering in a short period it was certain however that a       relapse had taken place the color disappeared from both eyelid       and cheek leaving a wanness even more than that of marble the       lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly       expression of death a repulsive clamminess and coldness       overspread rapidly the surface of the body and all the usual       rigorous illness immediately supervened i fell back with a       shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly       aroused and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of       ligeia        an hour thus elapsed when could it be possible i was a second       time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the       bed i listenedin extremity of horror the sound came againit       was a sigh rushing to the corpse i sawdistinctly sawa tremor       upon the lips in a minute afterward they relaxed disclosing a       bright line of the pearly teeth amazement now struggled in my       bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there       alone i felt that my vision grew dim that my reason wandered       and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in       nerving myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed       out there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the       cheek and throat a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame       there was even a slight pulsation at the heart the lady lived       and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of       restoration i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands and       used every exertion which experience and no little medical       reading could suggest but in vain suddenly the color fled       the pulsation ceased the lips resumed the expression of the       dead and in an instant afterward the whole body took upon       itself the icy chilliness the livid hue the intense rigidity       the sunken outline and all the loathsome peculiarities of that       which has been for many days a tenant of the tomb        and again i sunk into visions of ligeiaand again what marvel       that i shudder while i write again there reached my ears a low       sob from the region of the ebony bed but why shall i minutely       detail the unspeakable horrors of that night why shall i pause       to relate how time after time until near the period of the gray       dawn this hideous drama of revivification was repeated how each       terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more       irredeemable death how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle       with some invisible foe and how each struggle was succeeded by i       know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the       corpse let me hurry to a conclusion        the greater part of the fearful night had worn away and she who       had been dead once again stirredand now more vigorously than       hitherto although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in       its utter hopelessness than any i had long ceased to struggle or       to move and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman a       helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions of which extreme       awe was perhaps the least terrible the least consuming the       corpse i repeat stirred and now more vigorously than before       the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the       countenancethe limbs relaxedand save that the eyelids were yet       pressed heavily together and that the bandages and draperies of       the grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure i       might have dreamed that rowena had indeed shaken off utterly       the fetters of death but if this idea was not even then       altogether adopted i could at least doubt no longer when       arising from the bed tottering with feeble steps with closed       eyes and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream the thing       that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle       of the apartment        i trembled noti stirred notfor a crowd of unutterable fancies       connected with the air the stature the demeanor of the figure       rushing hurriedly through my brain had paralyzedhad chilled me       into stone i stirred notbut gazed upon the apparition there       was a mad disorder in my thoughtsa tumult unappeasable could       it indeed be the living rowena who confronted me could it       indeed be rowena at allthe fairhaired the blueeyed lady       rowena trevanion of tremaine why why should i doubt it the       bandage lay heavily about the mouthbut then might it not be the       mouth of the breathing lady of tremaine and the cheeksthere       were the roses as in her noon of lifeyes these might indeed be       the fair cheeks of the living lady of tremaine and the chin       with its dimples as in health might it not be hersbut had she       then grown taller since her malady what inexpressible madness       seized me with that thought one bound and i had reached her       feet shrinking from my touch she let fall from her head       unloosened the ghastly cerements which had confined it and       there streamed forth into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber       huge masses of long and dishevelled hair it was blacker than       the raven wings of the midnight and now slowly opened the eyes       of the figure which stood before me here then at least i       shrieked aloud can i nevercan i never be mistakenthese are       the full and the black and the wild eyesof my lost loveof the       ladyof the lady ligeia     morella        itself by itself solely one everlasting and single                     platosympos        with a feeling of deep yet most singular affection i regarded my       friend morella thrown by accident into her society many years       ago my soul from our first meeting burned with fires it had       never before known but the fires were not of eros and bitter       and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that i       could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their       vague intensity yet we met and fate bound us together at the       altar and i never spoke of passion nor thought of love she       however shunned society and attaching herself to me alone       rendered me happy it is a happiness to wonder it is a happiness       to dream        morellas erudition was profound as i hope to live her talents       were of no common orderher powers of mind were gigantic i felt       this and in many matters became her pupil i soon however       found that perhaps on account of her presburg education she       placed before me a number of those mystical writings which are       usually considered the mere dross of the early german literature       these for what reason i could not imagine were her favourite       and constant studyand that in process of time they became my       own should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence       of habit and example        in all this if i err not my reason had little to do my       convictions or i forget myself were in no manner acted upon by       the ideal nor was any tincture of the mysticism which i read to       be discovered unless i am greatly mistaken either in my deeds       or in my thoughts persuaded of this i abandoned myself       implicitly to the guidance of my wife and entered with an       unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies and       thenthen when poring over forbidden pages i felt a forbidden       spirit enkindling within mewould morella place her cold hand       upon my own and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some       low singular words whose strange meaning burned themselves in       upon my memory and then hour after hour would i linger by her       side and dwell upon the music of her voice until at length its       melody was tainted with terror and there fell a shadow upon my       soul and i grew pale and shuddered inwardly at those too       unearthly tones and thus joy suddenly faded into horror and       the most beautiful became the most hideous as hinnon became       gehenna        it is unnecessary to state the exact character of those       disquisitions which growing out of the volumes i have mentioned       formed for so long a time almost the sole conversation of       morella and myself by the learned in what might be termed       theological morality they will be readily conceived and by the       unlearned they would at all events be little understood the       wild pantheism of fichte the modified paliggenedia of the       pythagoreans and above all the doctrines of identity as urged       by schelling were generally the points of discussion presenting       the most of beauty to the imaginative morella that identity       which is termed personal mr locke i think truly defines to       consist in the saneness of rational being and since by person we       understand an intelligent essence having reason and since there       is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking it is this       which makes us all to be that which we call ourselvesthereby       distinguishing us from other beings that think and giving us our       personal identity but the principium indivduationis the       notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost       foreverwas to me at all times a consideration of intense       interest not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its       consequences than from the marked and agitated manner in which       morella mentioned them        but indeed the time had now arrived when the mystery of my       wifes manner oppressed me as a spell i could no longer bear the       touch of her wan fingers nor the low tone of her musical       language nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes and she knew all       this but did not upbraid she seemed conscious of my weakness or       my folly and smiling called it fate she seemed also       conscious of a cause to me unknown for the gradual alienation       of my regard but she gave me no hint or token of its nature yet       was she woman and pined away daily in time the crimson spot       settled steadily upon the cheek and the blue veins upon the pale       forehead became prominent and one instant my nature melted into       pity but in next i met the glance of her meaning eyes and then       my soul sickened and became giddy with the giddiness of one who       gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss        shall i then say that i longed with an earnest and consuming       desire for the moment of morellas decease i did but the       fragile spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many daysfor       many weeks and irksome months until my tortured nerves obtained       the mastery over my mind and i grew furious through delay and       with the heart of a fiend cursed the days and the hours and the       bitter moments which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as her       gentle life declinedlike shadows in the dying of the day        but one autumnal evening when the winds lay still in heaven       morella called me to her bedside there was a dim mist over all       the earth and a warm glow upon the waters and amid the rich       october leaves of the forest a rainbow from the firmament had       surely fallen        it is a day of days she said as i approached a day of all       days either to live or die it is a fair day for the sons of       earth and lifeah more fair for the daughters of heaven and       death        i kissed her forehead and she continued        i am dying yet shall i live        morella        the days have never been when thou couldst love mebut her whom       in life thou didst abhor in death thou shalt adore        morella        i repeat that i am dying but within me is a pledge of that       affectionah how littlewhich thou didst feel for me morella       and when my spirit departs shall the child livethy child and       mine morellas but thy days shall be days of sorrowthat sorrow       which is the most lasting of impressions as the cypress is the       most enduring of trees for the hours of thy happiness are over       and joy is not gathered twice in a life as the roses of paestum       twice in a year thou shalt no longer then play the teian with       time but being ignorant of the myrtle and the vine thou shalt       bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth as do the moslemin       at mecca        morella i cried morella how knowest thou this but she       turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming       over her limbs she thus died and i heard her voice no more        yet as she had foretold her child to which in dying she had       given birth which breathed not until the mother breathed no       more her child a daughter lived and she grew strangely in       stature and intellect and was the perfect resemblance of her who       had departed and i loved her with a love more fervent than i had       believed it possible to feel for any denizen of earth        but ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened       and gloom and horror and grief swept over it in clouds i said       the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence strange       indeed was her rapid increase in bodily sizebut terrible oh       terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while       watching the development of her mental being could it be       otherwise when i daily discovered in the conceptions of the       child the adult powers and faculties of the womanwhen the       lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy and when the       wisdom or the passions of maturity i found hourly gleaming from       its full and speculative eye when i say all this became       evident to my appalled senseswhen i could no longer hide it from       my soul nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled       to receive itis it to be wondered at that suspicions of a       nature fearful and exciting crept in upon my spirit or that my       thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling       theories of the entombed morella i snatched from the scrutiny of       the world a being whom destiny compelled me to adore and in the       rigorous seclusion of my home watched with an agonizing anxiety       over all which concerned the beloved        and as years rolled away and i gazed day after day upon her       holy and mild and eloquent face and poured over her maturing       form day after day did i discover new points of resemblance in       the child to her mother the melancholy and the dead and hourly       grew darker these shadows of similitude and more full and more       definite and more perplexing and more hideously terrible in       their aspect for that her smile was like her mothers i could       bear but then i shuddered at its too perfect identitythat her       eyes were like morellas i could endure but then they too       often looked down into the depths of my soul with morellas own       intense and bewildering meaning and in the contour of the high       forehead and in the ringlets of the silken hair and in the wan       fingers which buried themselves therein and in the sad musical       tones of her speech and above alloh above allin the phrases       and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the       living i found food for consuming thought and horrorfor a worm       that would not die        thus passed away two lustra of her life and as yet my daughter       remained nameless upon the earth my child and my love were       the designations usually prompted by a fathers affection and       the rigid seclusion of her days precluded all other intercourse       morellas name died with her at her death of the mother i had       never spoken to the daughterit was impossible to speak indeed       during the brief period of her existence the latter had received       no impressions from the outward world save such as might have       been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy but at length       the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind in its unnerved and       agitated condition a present deliverance from the terrors of my       destiny and at the baptismal font i hesitated for a name and       many titles of the wise and beautiful of old and modern times       of my own and foreign lands came thronging to my lips with       many many fair titles of the gentle and the happy and the       good what prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried       dead what demon urged me to breathe that sound which in its       very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in       torrents from the temples to the heart what fiend spoke from the       recesses of my soul when amid those dim aisles and in the       silence of the night i whispered within the ears of the holy man       the syllablesmorella what more than fiend convulsed the       features of my child and overspread them with hues of death as       starting at that scarcely audible sound she turned her glassy       eyes from the earth to heaven and falling prostrate on the black       slabs of our ancestral vault respondedi am here        distinct coldly calmly distinct fell those few simple sounds       within my ear and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into       my brain yearsyears may pass away but the memory of that       epochnever nor was i indeed ignorant of the flowers and the       vinebut the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and       day and i kept no reckoning of time or place and the stars of       my fate faded from heaven and therefore the earth grew dark and       its figures passed by me like flitting shadows and among them       all i beheld onlymorella the winds of the firmament breathed       but one sound within my ears and the ripples upon the sea       murmured evermoremorella but she died and with my own hands i       bore her to the tomb and i laughed with a long and bitter laugh       as i found no traces of the first in the charnel where i laid the       second morella     a tale of the ragged mountains         during the fall of the year  while residing near       charlottesville virginia i casually made the acquaintance of       mr augustus bedloe this young gentleman was remarkable in every       respect and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity i       found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his       physical relations of his family i could obtain no satisfactory       account whence he came i never ascertained even about his       agealthough i call him a young gentlemanthere was something       which perplexed me in no little degree he certainly seemed       youngand he made a point of speaking about his youthyet there       were moments when i should have had little trouble in imagining       him a hundred years of age but in no regard was he more peculiar       than in his personal appearance he was singularly tall and thin       he stooped much his limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated       his forehead was broad and low his complexion was absolutely       bloodless his mouth was large and flexible and his teeth were       more wildly uneven although sound than i had ever before seen       teeth in a human head the expression of his smile however was       by no means unpleasing as might be supposed but it had no       variation whatever it was one of profound melancholyof a       phaseless and unceasing gloom his eyes were abnormally large       and round like those of a cat the pupils too upon any       accession or diminution of light underwent contraction or       dilation just such as is observed in the feline tribe in       moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost       inconceivable seeming to emit luminous rays not of a reflected       but of an intrinsic lustre as does a candle or the sun yet       their ordinary condition was so totally vapid filmy and dull as       to convey the idea of the eyes of a longinterred corpse        these peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much       annoyance and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of       half explanatory half apologetic strain which when i first       heard it impressed me very painfully i soon however grew       accustomed to it and my uneasiness wore off it seemed to be his       design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that       physically he had not always been what he wasthat a long series       of neuralgic attacks had reduced him from a condition of more       than usual personal beauty to that which i saw for many years       past he had been attended by a physician named templetonan old       gentleman perhaps seventy years of agewhom he had first       encountered at saratoga and from whose attention while there       he either received or fancied that he received great benefit       the result was that bedloe who was wealthy had made an       arrangement with dr templeton by which the latter in       consideration of a liberal annual allowance had consented to       devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of       the invalid        doctor templeton had been a traveller in his younger days and at       paris had become a convert in great measure to the doctrines of       mesmer it was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he       had succeeded in alleviating the acute pains of his patient and       this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a       certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the       remedies had been educed the doctor however like all       enthusiasts had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his       pupil and finally so far gained his point as to induce the       sufferer to submit to numerous experiments by a frequent       repetition of these a result had arisen which of late days has       become so common as to attract little or no attention but which       at the period of which i write had very rarely been known in       america i mean to say that between doctor templeton and bedloe       there had grown up little by little a very distinct and       strongly marked rapport or magnetic relation i am not prepared       to assert however that this rapport extended beyond the limits       of the simple sleepproducing power but this power itself had       attained great intensity at the first attempt to induce the       magnetic somnolency the mesmerist entirely failed in the fifth       or sixth he succeeded very partially and after long continued       effort only at the twelfth was the triumph complete after this       the will of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the       physician so that when i first became acquainted with the two       sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere       volition of the operator even when the invalid was unaware of       his presence it is only now in the year  when similar       miracles are witnessed daily by thousands that i dare venture to       record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact        the temperature of bedloe was in the highest degree sensitive       excitable enthusiastic his imagination was singularly vigorous       and creative and no doubt it derived additional force from the       habitual use of morphine which he swallowed in great quantity       and without which he would have found it impossible to exist it       was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately       after breakfast each morningor rather immediately after a cup       of strong coffee for he ate nothing in the forenoonand then set       forth alone or attended only by a dog upon a long ramble among       the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and       southward of charlottesville and are there dignified by the       title of the ragged mountains        upon a dim warm misty day toward the close of november and       during the strange interregnum of the seasons which in america is       termed the indian summer mr bedloe departed as usual for the       hills the day passed and still he did not return        about eight oclock at night having become seriously alarmed at       his protracted absence we were about setting out in search of       him when he unexpectedly made his appearance in health no worse       than usual and in rather more than ordinary spirits the account       which he gave of his expedition and of the events which had       detained him was a singular one indeed        you will remember said he that it was about nine in the       morning when i left charlottesville i bent my steps immediately       to the mountains and about ten entered a gorge which was       entirely new to me i followed the windings of this pass with       much interest the scenery which presented itself on all sides       although scarcely entitled to be called grand had about it an       indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation       the solitude seemed absolutely virgin i could not help believing       that the green sods and the gray rocks upon which i trod had been       trodden never before by the foot of a human being so entirely       secluded and in fact inaccessible except through a series of       accidents is the entrance of the ravine that it is by no means       impossible that i was indeed the first adventurerthe very first       and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses        the thick and peculiar mist or smoke which distinguishes the       indian summer and which now hung heavily over all objects       served no doubt to deepen the vague impressions which these       objects created so dense was this pleasant fog that i could at       no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me this       path was excessively sinuous and as the sun could not be seen i       soon lost all idea of the direction in which i journeyed in the       meantime the morphine had its customary effectthat of enduing       all the external world with an intensity of interest in the       quivering of a leafin the hue of a blade of grassin the shape       of a trefoilin the humming of a beein the gleaming of a       dewdropin the breathing of the windin the faint odors that       came from the forestthere came a whole universe of suggestiona       gay and motley train of rhapsodical and immethodical thought        busied in this i walked on for several hours during which the       mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length i       was reduced to an absolute groping of the way and now an       indescribable uneasiness possessed mea species of nervous       hesitation and tremor i feared to tread lest i should be       precipitated into some abyss i remembered too strange stories       told about these ragged hills and of the uncouth and fierce       races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns a thousand       vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted mefancies the more       distressing because vague very suddenly my attention was       arrested by the loud beating of a drum        my amazement was of course extreme a drum in these hills was       a thing unknown i could not have been more surprised at the       sound of the trump of the archangel but a new and still more       astounding source of interest and perplexity arose there came a       wild rattling or jingling sound as if of a bunch of large keys       and upon the instant a duskyvisaged and halfnaked man rushed       past me with a shriek he came so close to my person that i felt       his hot breath upon my face he bore in one hand an instrument       composed of an assemblage of steel rings and shook them       vigorously as he ran scarcely had he disappeared in the mist       before panting after him with open mouth and glaring eyes       there darted a huge beast i could not be mistaken in its       character it was a hyena        the sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my       terrorsfor i now made sure that i dreamed and endeavored to       arouse myself to waking consciousness i stepped boldly and       briskly forward i rubbed my eyes i called aloud i pinched my       limbs a small spring of water presented itself to my view and       here stooping i bathed my hands and my head and neck this       seemed to dissipate the equivocal sensations which had hitherto       annoyed me i arose as i thought a new man and proceeded       steadily and complacently on my unknown way        at length quite overcome by exertion and by a certain       oppressive closeness of the atmosphere i seated myself beneath a       tree presently there came a feeble gleam of sunshine and the       shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon       the grass at this shadow i gazed wonderingly for many minutes       its character stupefied me with astonishment i looked upward       the tree was a palm        i now arose hurriedly and in a state of fearful agitationfor       the fancy that i dreamed would serve me no longer i sawi felt       that i had perfect command of my sensesand these senses now       brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation the       heat became all at once intolerable a strange odor loaded the       breeze a low continuous murmur like that arising from a full       but gently flowing river came to my ears intermingled with the       peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices        while i listened in an extremity of astonishment which i need       not attempt to describe a strong and brief gust of wind bore off       the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an enchanter        i found myself at the foot of a high mountain and looking down       into a vast plain through which wound a majestic river on the       margin of this river stood an easternlooking city such as we       read of in the arabian tales but of a character even more       singular than any there described from my position which was       far above the level of the town i could perceive its every nook       and corner as if delineated on a map the streets seemed       innumerable and crossed each other irregularly in all       directions but were rather long winding alleys than streets and       absolutely swarmed with inhabitants the houses were wildly       picturesque on every hand was a wilderness of balconies of       verandas of minarets of shrines and fantastically carved       oriels bazaars abounded and in these were displayed rich wares       in infinite variety and profusionsilks muslins the most       dazzling cutlery the most magnificent jewels and gems besides       these things were seen on all sides banners and palanquins       litters with stately dames closeveiled elephants gorgeously       caparisoned idols grotesquely hewn drums banners and gongs       spears silver and gilded maces and amid the crowd and the       clamor and the general intricacy and confusionamid the million       of black and yellow men turbaned and robed and of flowing       beard there roamed a countless multitude of holy filleted bulls       while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered       chattering and shrieking about the cornices of the mosques or       clung to the minarets and oriels from the swarming streets to       the banks of the river there descended innumerable flights of       steps leading to bathing places while the river itself seemed to       force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of       deeplyburthened ships that far and wide encountered its surface       beyond the limits of the city arose in frequent majestic groups       the palm and the cocoa with other gigantic and weird trees of       vast age and here and there might be seen a field of rice the       thatched hut of a peasant a tank a stray temple a gypsy camp       or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way with a pitcher upon       her head to the banks of the magnificent river        you will say now of course that i dreamed but not so what i       sawwhat i heardwhat i feltwhat i thoughthad about it nothing       of the unmistakable idiosyncrasy of the dream all was rigorously       selfconsistent at first doubting that i was really awake i       entered into a series of tests which soon convinced me that i       really was now when one dreams and in the dream suspects       that he dreams the suspicion never fails to confirm itself and       the sleeper is almost immediately aroused thus novalis errs not       in saying that we are near waking when we dream that we dream       had the vision occurred to me as i describe it without my       suspecting it as a dream then a dream it might absolutely have       been but occurring as it did and suspected and tested as it       was i am forced to class it among other phenomena        in this i am not sure that you are wrong observed dr       templeton but proceed you arose and descended into the city        i arose continued bedloe regarding the doctor with an air of       profound astonishment i arose as you say and descended into       the city on my way i fell in with an immense populace crowding       through every avenue all in the same direction and exhibiting       in every action the wildest excitement very suddenly and by       some inconceivable impulse i became intensely imbued with       personal interest in what was going on i seemed to feel that i       had an important part to play without exactly understanding what       it was against the crowd which environed me however i       experienced a deep sentiment of animosity i shrank from amid       them and swiftly by a circuitous path reached and entered the       city here all was the wildest tumult and contention a small       party of men clad in garments half indian half european and       officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly british were engaged       at great odds with the swarming rabble of the alleys i joined       the weaker party arming myself with the weapons of a fallen       officer and fighting i knew not whom with the nervous ferocity       of despair we were soon overpowered by numbers and driven to       seek refuge in a species of kiosk here we barricaded ourselves       and for the present were secure from a loophole near the       summit of the kiosk i perceived a vast crowd in furious       agitation surrounding and assaulting a gay palace that overhung       the river presently from an upper window of this place there       descended an effeminatelooking person by means of a string made       of the turbans of his attendants a boat was at hand in which he       escaped to the opposite bank of the river        and now a new object took possession of my soul i spoke a few       hurried but energetic words to my companions and having       succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a       frantic sally from the kiosk we rushed amid the crowd that       surrounded it they retreated at first before us they rallied       fought madly and retreated again in the mean time we were borne       far from the kiosk and became bewildered and entangled among the       narrow streets of tall overhanging houses into the recesses of       which the sun had never been able to shine the rabble pressed       impetuously upon us harrassing us with their spears and       overwhelming us with flights of arrows these latter were very       remarkable and resembled in some respects the writhing creese of       the malay they were made to imitate the body of a creeping       serpent and were long and black with a poisoned barb one of       them struck me upon the right temple i reeled and fell an       instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me i struggledi       gaspedi died         you will hardly persist now said i smiling that the whole        of your adventure was not a dream you are not prepared to        maintain that you are dead        when i said these words i of course expected some lively sally       from bedloe in reply but to my astonishment he hesitated       trembled became fearfully pallid and remained silent i looked       toward templeton he sat erect and rigid in his chairhis teeth       chattered and his eyes were starting from their sockets       proceed he at length said hoarsely to bedloe        for many minutes continued the latter my sole sentimentmy       sole feelingwas that of darkness and nonentity with the       consciousness of death at length there seemed to pass a violent       and sudden shock through my soul as if of electricity with it       came the sense of elasticity and of light this latter i feltnot       saw in an instant i seemed to rise from the ground but i had no       bodily no visible audible or palpable presence the crowd had       departed the tumult had ceased the city was in comparative       repose beneath me lay my corpse with the arrow in my temple       the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured but all these       things i feltnot saw i took interest in nothing even the       corpse seemed a matter in which i had no concern volition i had       none but appeared to be impelled into motion and flitted       buoyantly out of the city retracing the circuitous path by which       i had entered it when i had attained that point of the ravine in       the mountains at which i had encountered the hyena i again       experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery the sense of       weight of volition of substance returned i became my original       self and bent my steps eagerly homewardbut the past had not       lost the vividness of the realand not now even for an instant       can i compel my understanding to regard it as a dream        nor was it said templeton with an air of deep solemnity yet       it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed       let us suppose only that the soul of the man of today is upon       the verge of some stupendous psychal discoveries let us content       ourselves with this supposition for the rest i have some       explanation to make here is a watercolor drawing which i should       have shown you before but which an unaccountable sentiment of       horror has hitherto prevented me from showing        we looked at the picture which he presented i saw nothing in it       of an extraordinary character but its effect upon bedloe was       prodigious he nearly fainted as he gazed and yet it was but a       miniature portraita miraculously accurate one to be sureof his       own very remarkable features at least this was my thought as i       regarded it        you will perceive said templeton the date of this pictureit       is here scarcely visible in this corner in this year was       the portrait taken it is the likeness of a dead frienda mr       oldebto whom i became much attached at calcutta during the       administration of warren hastings i was then only twenty years       old when i first saw you mr bedloe at saratoga it was the       miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the       painting which induced me to accost you to seek your friendship       and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my       becoming your constant companion in accomplishing this point i       was urged partly and perhaps principally by a regretful memory       of the deceased but also in part by an uneasy and not       altogether horrorless curiosity respecting yourself        in your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid       the hills you have described with the minutest accuracy the       indian city of benares upon the holy river the riots the       combat the massacre were the actual events of the insurrection       of cheyte sing which took place in  when hastings was put       in imminent peril of his life the man escaping by the string of       turbans was cheyte sing himself the party in the kiosk were       sepoys and british officers headed by hastings of this party i       was one and did all i could to prevent the rash and fatal sally       of the officer who fell in the crowded alleys by the poisoned       arrow of a bengalee that officer was my dearest friend it was       oldeb you will perceive by these manuscripts here the speaker       produced a notebook in which several pages appeared to have been       freshly written that at the very period in which you fancied       these things amid the hills i was engaged in detailing them upon       paper here at home        in about a week after this conversation the following paragraphs       appeared in a charlottesville paper        we have the painful duty of announcing the death of mr augustus       bedlo a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have       long endeared him to the citizens of charlottesville        mr b for some years past has been subject to neuralgia       which has often threatened to terminate fatally but this can be       regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease the proximate       cause was one of especial singularity in an excursion to the       ragged mountains a few days since a slight cold and fever were       contracted attended with great determination of blood to the       head to relieve this dr templeton resorted to topical       bleeding leeches were applied to the temples in a fearfully       brief period the patient died when it appeared that in the jar       containing the leeches had been introduced by accident one of       the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in       the neighboring ponds this creature fastened itself upon a small       artery in the right temple its close resemblance to the       medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too       late        n bthe poisonous sangsue of charlottesville may always be       distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness and       especially by its writhing or vermicular motions which very       nearly resemble those of a snake        i was speaking with the editor of the paper in question upon the       topic of this remarkable accident when it occurred to me to ask       how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as       bedlo        i presume i said you have authority for this spelling but i       have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the       end        authorityno he replied it is a mere typographical error       the name is bedlo with an e all the world over and i never knew       it to be spelt otherwise in my life        then said i mutteringly as i turned upon my heel then       indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any       fictionfor bedloe without the e what is it but oldeb       conversed and this man tells me that it is a typographical       error     the spectacles         many years ago it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of love       at first sight but those who think not less than those who       feel deeply have always advocated its existence modern       discoveries indeed in what may be termed ethical magnetism or       magnetoesthetics render it probable that the most natural and       consequently the truest and most intense of the human affections       are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathyin       a word that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal       fetters are those which are riveted by a glance the confession i       am about to make will add another to the already almost       innumerable instances of the truth of the position        my story requires that i should be somewhat minute i am still a       very young mannot yet twentytwo years of age my name at       present is a very usual and rather plebeian onesimpson i say       at present for it is only lately that i have been so       calledhaving legislatively adopted this surname within the last       year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant       male relative adolphus simpson esq the bequest was conditioned       upon my taking the name of the testatorthe family not the       christian name my christian name is napoleon bonaparteor more       properly these are my first and middle appellations        i assumed the name simpson with some reluctance as in my true       patronym froissart i felt a very pardonable pridebelieving       that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the       chronicles while on the subject of names by the bye i may       mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of       some of my immediate predecessors my father was a monsieur       froissart of paris his wifemy mother whom he married at       fifteenwas a mademoiselle croissart eldest daughter of       croissart the banker whose wife again being only sixteen when       married was the eldest daughter of one victor voissart monsieur       voissart very singularly had married a lady of similar namea       mademoiselle moissart she too was quite a child when married       and her mother also madame moissart was only fourteen when led       to the altar these early marriages are usual in france here       however are moissart voissart croissart and froissart all in       the direct line of descent my own name though as i say became       simpson by act of legislature and with so much repugnance on my       part that at one period i actually hesitated about accepting       the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached        as to personal endowments i am by no means deficient on the       contrary i believe that i am well made and possess what nine       tenths of the world would call a handsome face in height i am       five feet eleven my hair is black and curling my nose is       sufficiently good my eyes are large and gray and although in       fact they are weak to a very inconvenient degree still no defect       in this regard would be suspected from their appearance the       weakness itself however has always much annoyed me and i have       resorted to every remedyshort of wearing glasses being youthful       and goodlooking i naturally dislike these and have resolutely       refused to employ them i know nothing indeed which so       disfigures the countenance of a young person or so impresses       every feature with an air of demureness if not altogether of       sanctimoniousness and of age an eyeglass on the other hand has       a savor of downright foppery and affectation i have hitherto       managed as well as i could without either but something too much       of these merely personal details which after all are of little       importance i will content myself with saying in addition that       my temperament is sanguine rash ardent enthusiasticand that       all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women        one night last winter i entered a box at the p theatre in       company with a friend mr talbot it was an opera night and the       bills presented a very rare attraction so that the house was       excessively crowded we were in time however to obtain the       front seats which had been reserved for us and into which with       some little difficulty we elbowed our way        for two hours my companion who was a musical fanatico gave his       undivided attention to the stage and in the meantime i amused       myself by observing the audience which consisted in chief part       of the very elite of the city having satisfied myself upon this       point i was about turning my eyes to the prima donna when they       were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes       which had escaped my observation        if i live a thousand years i can never forget the intense       emotion with which i regarded this figure it was that of a       female the most exquisite i had ever beheld the face was so far       turned toward the stage that for some minutes i could not       obtain a view of itbut the form was divine no other word can       sufficiently express its magnificent proportionand even the term       divine seems ridiculously feeble as i write it        the magic of a lovely form in womanthe necromancy of female       gracefulnesswas always a power which i had found it impossible       to resist but here was grace personified incarnate the beau       ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions the figure       almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be       seen was somewhat above the medium height and nearly       approached without positively reaching the majestic its       perfect fullness and tournure were delicious the head of which       only the back was visible rivalled in outline that of the greek       psyche and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap       of gaze äérienne which put me in mind of the ventum textilem       of apuleius the right arm hung over the balustrade of the box       and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry       its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves       now in fashion this extended but little below the elbow beneath       it was worn an under one of some frail material closefitting       and terminated by a cuff of rich lace which fell gracefully over       the top of the hand revealing only the delicate fingers upon       one of which sparkled a diamond ring which i at once saw was of       extraordinary value the admirable roundness of the wrist was       well set off by a bracelet which encircled it and which also was       ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of       jewelstelling in words that could not be mistaken at once of       the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer        i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour as       if i had been suddenly converted to stone and during this       period i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said       or sung concerning love at first sight my feelings were       totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced in       the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female       loveliness an unaccountable and what i am compelled to consider       a magnetic sympathy of soul for soul seemed to rivet not only       my vision but my whole powers of thought and feeling upon the       admirable object before me i sawi felti knew that i was       deeply madly irrevocably in loveand this even before seeing       the face of the person beloved so intense indeed was the       passion that consumed me that i really believe it would have       received little if any abatement had the features yet unseen       proved of merely ordinary character so anomalous is the nature       of the only true loveof the love at first sightand so little       really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only       seem to create and control it        while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision a       sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head       partially toward me so that i beheld the entire profile of the       face its beauty even exceeded my anticipationsand yet there was       something about it which disappointed me without my being able to       tell exactly what it was i said disappointed but this is not       altogether the word my sentiments were at once quieted and       exalted they partook less of transport and more of calm       enthusiasmof enthusiastic repose this state of feeling arose       perhaps from the madonnalike and matronly air of the face and       yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely       from this there was something elsesome mystery which i could       not developesome expression about the countenance which slightly       disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest in fact i       was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and       susceptible man for any act of extravagance had the lady been       alone i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her       at all hazards but fortunately she was attended by two       companionsa gentleman and a strikingly beautiful woman to all       appearance a few years younger than herself        i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain       hereafter an introduction to the elder lady or for the       present at all events a more distinct view of her beauty i       would have removed my position to one nearer her own but the       crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible and the       stern decrees of fashion had of late imperatively prohibited       the use of the operaglass in a case such as this even had i       been so fortunate as to have one with mebut i had notand was       thus in despair        at length i bethought me of applying to my companion        talbot i said you have an operaglass let me have it        an operaglassnowhat do you suppose i would be doing with an       operaglass here he turned impatiently toward the stage        but talbot i continued pulling him by the shoulder listen       to me will you do you see the stageboxthereno the next       did you ever behold as lovely a woman        she is very beautiful no doubt he said        i wonder who she can be        why in the name of all that is angelic dont you know who she       is not to know her argues yourself unknown she is the       celebrated madame lalandethe beauty of the day par excellence       and the talk of the whole town immensely wealthy tooa widow       and a great matchhas just arrived from paris        do you know her        yes i have the honor        will you introduce me        assuredly with the greatest pleasure when shall it be        tomorrow at one i will call upon you at bs        very good and now do hold your tongue if you can        in this latter respect i was forced to take talbots advice for       he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or       suggestion and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the       evening with what was transacting upon the stage        in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande and at       length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her       face it was exquisitely lovelythis of course my heart had       told me before even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the       pointbut still the unintelligible something disturbed me i       finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air       of gravity sadness or still more properly of weariness which       took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance       only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty and       thus of course to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment with       an interest tenfold        while i thus feasted my eyes i perceived at last to my great       trepidation by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the       lady that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my       gaze still i was absolutely fascinated and could not withdraw       it even for an instant she turned aside her face and again i       saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head       after some minutes as if urged by curiosity to see if i was       still looking she gradually brought her face again around and       again encountered my burning gaze her large dark eyes fell       instantly and a deep blush mantled her cheek but what was my       astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second       time avert her head but that she actually took from her girdle a       double eyeglasselevated itadjusted itand then regarded me       through it intently and deliberately for the space of several       minutes        had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more       thoroughly astoundedastounded onlynot offended or disgusted in       the slightest degree although an action so bold in any other       woman would have been likely to offend or disgust but the whole       thing was done with so much quietudeso much nonchalanceso much       reposewith so evident an air of the highest breeding in       shortthat nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible and my       sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise        i observed that upon her first elevation of the glass she had       seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person and       was withdrawing the instrument when as if struck by a second       thought she resumed it and so continued to regard me with fixed       attention for the space of several minutesfor five minutes at       the very least i am sure        this action so remarkable in an american theatre attracted very       general observation and gave rise to an indefinite movement or       buzz among the audience which for a moment filled me with       confusion but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of       madame lalande        having satisfied her curiosityif such it wasshe dropped the       glass and quietly gave her attention again to the stage her       profile now being turned toward myself as before i continued to       watch her unremittingly although i was fully conscious of my       rudeness in so doing presently i saw the head slowly and       slightly change its position and soon i became convinced that       the lady while pretending to look at the stage was in fact       attentively regarding myself it is needless to say what effect       this conduct on the part of so fascinating a woman had upon my       excitable mind        having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour the       fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended       her and while she spoke i saw distinctly by the glances of       both that the conversation had reference to myself        upon its conclusion madame lalande again turned toward the       stage and for a few minutes seemed absorbed in the       performance at the expiration of this period however i was       thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold for       the second time the eyeglass which hung at her side fully       confront me as before and disregarding the renewed buzz of the       audience survey me from head to foot with the same miraculous       composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my       soul        this extraordinary behavior by throwing me into a perfect fever       of excitementinto an absolute delirium of loveserved rather to       embolden than to disconcert me in the mad intensity of my       devotion i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic       loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze watching my       opportunity when i thought the audience were fully engaged with       the opera i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande and       upon the instant made a slight but unmistakable bow        she blushed very deeplythen averted her eyesthen slowly and       cautiously looked around apparently to see if my rash action had       been noticedthen leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her       side        i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed       and expected nothing less than instant exposure while a vision       of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably       through my brain i was greatly and immediately relieved       however when i saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a       playbill without speaking but the reader may form some feeble       conception of my astonishmentof my profound amazementmy       delirious bewilderment of heart and soulwhen instantly       afterward having again glanced furtively around she allowed her       bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own and then with       a faint smile disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth made       two distinct pointed and unequivocal affirmative inclinations       of the head        it is useless of course to dwell upon my joyupon my       transportupon my illimitable ecstasy of heart if ever man was       mad with excess of happiness it was myself at that moment i       loved this was my first loveso i felt it to be it was love       supremeindescribable it was love at first sight and at first       sight too it had been appreciated and returned        yes returned how and why should i doubt it for an instant what       other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct on the       part of a lady so beautifulso wealthyevidently so       accomplishedof so high breedingof so lofty a position in       societyin every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured       was madame lalande yes she loved meshe returned the enthusiasm       of my love with an enthusiasm as blindas uncompromisingas       uncalculatingas abandonedand as utterly unbounded as my own       these delicious fancies and reflections however were now       interrupted by the falling of the dropcurtain the audience       arose and the usual tumult immediately supervened quitting       talbot abruptly i made every effort to force my way into closer       proximity with madame lalande having failed in this on account       of the crowd i at length gave up the chase and bent my steps       homeward consoling myself for my disappointment in not having       been able to touch even the hem of her robe by the reflection       that i should be introduced by talbot in due form upon the       morrow        this morrow at last came that is to say a day finally dawned       upon a long and weary night of impatience and then the hours       until one were snailpaced dreary and innumerable but even       stamboul it is said shall have an end and there came an end to       this long delay the clock struck as the last echo ceased i       stepped into bs and inquired for talbot        out said the footmantalbots own        out i replied staggering back half a dozen paceslet me tell       you my fine fellow that this thing is thoroughly impossible and       impracticable mr talbot is not out what do you mean        nothing sir only mr talbot is not in thats all he rode       over to s immediately after breakfast and left word that he       would not be in town again for a week        i stood petrified with horror and rage i endeavored to reply       but my tongue refused its office at length i turned on my heel       livid with wrath and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the       talbots to the innermost regions of erebus it was evident that       my considerate friend il fanatico had quite forgotten his       appointment with myselfhad forgotten it as soon as it was made       at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word there was no       help for it so smothering my vexation as well as i could i       strolled moodily up the street propounding futile inquiries       about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met by report       she was known i found to allto many by sightbut she had been       in town only a few weeks and there were very few therefore who       claimed her personal acquaintance these few being still       comparatively strangers could not or would not take the       liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning       call while i stood thus in despair conversing with a trio of       friends upon the allabsorbing subject of my heart it so       happened that the subject itself passed by        as i live there she is cried one        surprisingly beautiful exclaimed a second        an angel upon earth ejaculated a third        i looked and in an open carriage which approached us passing       slowly down the street sat the enchanting vision of the opera       accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her       box        her companion also wears remarkably well said the one of my       trio who had spoken first        astonishingly said the second still quite a brilliant air       but art will do wonders upon my word she looks better than she       did at paris five years ago a beautiful woman stilldont you       think so froissartsimpson i mean        still said i and why shouldnt she be but compared with       her friend she is as a rushlight to the evening stara glowworm       to antares        ha ha hawhy simpson you have an astonishing tact at making       discoveriesoriginal ones i mean and here we separated while       one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville of which i       caught only the lines        ninon ninon ninon à bas       a bas ninon de lenclos        during this little scene however one thing had served greatly       to console me although it fed the passion by which i was       consumed as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group       i had observed that she recognized me and more than this she       had blessed me by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles       with no equivocal mark of the recognition        as for an introduction i was obliged to abandon all hope of it       until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the       country in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every       reputable place of public amusement and at length at the       theatre where i first saw her i had the supreme bliss of       meeting her and of exchanging glances with her once again this       did not occur however until the lapse of a fortnight every       day in the interim i had inquired for talbot at his hotel and       every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the       everlasting not come home yet of his footman        upon the evening in question therefore i was in a condition       little short of madness madame lalande i had been told was a       parisianhad lately arrived from parismight she not suddenly       returnreturn before talbot came backand might she not be thus       lost to me forever the thought was too terrible to bear since       my future happiness was at issue i resolved to act with a manly       decision in a word upon the breaking up of the play i traced       the lady to her residence noted the address and the next       morning sent her a full and elaborate letter in which i poured       out my whole heart        i spoke boldly freelyin a word i spoke with passion i       concealed nothingnothing even of my weakness i alluded to the       romantic circumstances of our first meetingeven to the glances       which had passed between us i went so far as to say that i felt       assured of her love while i offered this assurance and my own       intensity of devotion as two excuses for my otherwise       unpardonable conduct as a third i spoke of my fear that she       might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a       formal introduction i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic       epistle ever penned with a frank declaration of my worldly       circumstancesof my affluenceand with an offer of my heart and       of my hand        in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply after what seemed       the lapse of a century it came        yes actually came romantic as all this may appear i really       received a letter from madame lalandethe beautiful the wealthy       the idolized madame lalande her eyesher magnificent eyes had       not belied her noble heart like a true frenchwoman as she was       she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reasonthe generous       impulses of her naturedespising the conventional pruderies of       the world she had not scorned my proposals she had not       sheltered herself in silence she had not returned my letter       unopened she had even sent me in reply one penned by her own       exquisite fingers it ran thus        monsieur simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle       tong of his contrée so vell as might it is

extravagances that       have now escaped my memory still talbot would not return       alas could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering       his absence had occasioned his friend would not his sympathizing       nature have flown immediately to my relief still however he       came not i wrote he replied he was detained by urgent       businessbut would shortly return he begged me not to be       impatientto moderate my transportsto read soothing booksto       drink nothing stronger than hockand to bring the consolations of       philosophy to my aid the fool if he could not come himself       why in the name of every thing rational could he not have       enclosed me a letter of presentation i wrote him again       entreating him to forward one forthwith my letter was returned       by that footman with the following endorsement in pencil the       scoundrel had joined his master in the country        left s yesterday for parts unknowndid not say whereor when       be backso thought best to return letter knowing your       handwriting and as how you is always more or less in a hurry        yours sincerely        stubbs        after this it is needless to say that i devoted to the infernal       deities both master and valetbut there was little use in anger       and no consolation at all in complaint        but i had yet a resource left in my constitutional audacity       hitherto it had served me well and i now resolved to make it       avail me to the end besides after the correspondence which had       passed between us what act of mere informality could i commit       within bounds that ought to be regarded as indecorous by madame       lalande since the affair of the letter i had been in the habit       of watching her house and thus discovered that about twilight       it was her custom to promenade attended only by a negro in       livery in a public square overlooked by her windows here amid       the luxuriant and shadowing groves in the gray gloom of a sweet       midsummer evening i observed my opportunity and accosted her        the better to deceive the servant in attendance i did this with       the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance with a       presence of mind truly parisian she took the cue at once and       to greet me held out the most bewitchingly little of hands the       valet at once fell into the rear and now with hearts full to       overflowing we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love        as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote       it our conversation was necessarily in french in this sweet       tongue so adapted to passion i gave loose to the impetuous       enthusiasm of my nature and with all the eloquence i could       command besought her to consent to an immediate marriage        at this impatience she smiled she urged the old story of       decorumthat bugbear which deters so many from bliss until the       opportunity for bliss has forever gone by i had most imprudently       made it known among my friends she observed that i desired her       acquaintancethus that i did not possess itthus again there       was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge       of each other and then she adverted with a blush to the       extreme recency of this date to wed immediately would be       improperwould be indecorouswould be outre all this she said       with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved       and convinced me she went even so far as to accuse me       laughingly of rashnessof imprudence she bade me remember that       i really even knew not who she waswhat were her prospects her       connections her standing in society she begged me but with a       sigh to reconsider my proposal and termed my love an       infatuationa will o the wispa fancy or fantasy of the momenta       baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of       the heart these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet       twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around usand then with       a gentle pressure of her fairylike hand overthrew in a single       sweet instant all the argumentative fabric she had reared        i replied as best i couldas only a true lover can i spoke at       length and perseveringly of my devotion of my passionof her       exceeding beauty and of my own enthusiastic admiration in       conclusion i dwelt with a convincing energy upon the perils       that encompass the course of lovethat course of true love that       never did run smoothand thus deduced the manifest danger of       rendering that course unnecessarily long        this latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her       determination she relented but there was yet an obstacle she       said which she felt assured i had not properly considered this       was a delicate pointfor a woman to urge especially so in       mentioning it she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her       feelings still for me every sacrifice should be made she       alluded to the topic of age was i awarewas i fully aware of the       discrepancy between us that the age of the husband should       surpass by a few yearseven by fifteen or twentythe age of the       wife was regarded by the world as admissible and indeed as       even proper but she had always entertained the belief that the       years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the       husband a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise too       frequently alas to a life of unhappiness now she was aware       that my own age did not exceed two and twenty and i on the       contrary perhaps was not aware that the years of my eugénie       extended very considerably beyond that sum        about all this there was a nobility of soula dignity of       candorwhich delightedwhich enchanted mewhich eternally riveted       my chains i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport       which possessed me        my sweetest eugénie i cried what is all this about which you       are discoursing your years surpass in some measure my own but       what then the customs of the world are so many conventional       follies to those who love as ourselves in what respect differs       a year from an hour i am twentytwo you say granted indeed       you may as well call me at once twentythree now you yourself       my dearest eugénie can have numbered no more thancan have       numbered no more thanno more thanthanthanthan        here i paused for an instant in the expectation that madame       lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age but a       frenchwoman is seldom direct and has always by way of answer to       an embarrassing query some little practical reply of her own in       the present instance eugénie who for a few moments past had       seemed to be searching for something in her bosom at length let       fall upon the grass a miniature which i immediately picked up       and presented to her        keep it she said with one of her most ravishing smiles keep       it for my sakefor the sake of her whom it too flatteringly       represents besides upon the back of the trinket you may       discover perhaps the very information you seem to desire it is       now to be sure growing rather darkbut you can examine it at       your leisure in the morning in the meantime you shall be my       escort home tonight my friends are about holding a little       musical levée i can promise you too some good singing we       french are not nearly so punctilious as you americans and i       shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in in the character of       an old acquaintance        with this she took my arm and i attended her home the mansion       was quite a fine one and i believe furnished in good taste of       this latter point however i am scarcely qualified to judge for       it was just dark as we arrived and in american mansions of the       better sort lights seldom during the heat of summer make their       appearance at this the most pleasant period of the day in about       an hour after my arrival to be sure a single shaded solar lamp       was lit in the principal drawingroom and this apartment i       could thus see was arranged with unusual good taste and even       splendor but two other rooms of the suite and in which the       company chiefly assembled remained during the whole evening in       a very agreeable shadow this is a wellconceived custom giving       the party at least a choice of light or shade and one which our       friends over the water could not do better than immediately       adopt        the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of       my life madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities       of her friends and the singing i here heard i had never heard       excelled in any private circle out of vienna the instrumental       performers were many and of superior talents the vocalists were       chiefly ladies and no individual sang less than well at length       upon a peremptory call for madame lalande she arose at once       without affectation or demur from the chaise longue upon which       she had sat by my side and accompanied by one or two gentlemen       and her female friend of the opera repaired to the piano in the       main drawingroom i would have escorted her myself but felt       that under the circumstances of my introduction to the house i       had better remain unobserved where i was i was thus deprived of       the pleasure of seeing although not of hearing her sing        the impression she produced upon the company seemed       electricalbut the effect upon myself was something even more i       know not how adequately to describe it it arose in part no       doubt from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued but       chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the       singer it is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or       recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers her       utterance of the romance in otellothe tone with which she gave       the words sul mio sasso in the capulettiis ringing in my       memory yet her lower tones were absolutely miraculous her voice       embraced three complete octaves extending from the contralto d       to the d upper soprano and though sufficiently powerful to have       filled the san carlos executed with the minutest precision       every difficulty of vocal compositionascending and descending       scales cadences or fiorituri in the final of the somnambula       she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words       ah non guinge uman pensiero      al contento ond io son piena        here in imitation of malibran she modified the original phrase       of bellini so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g when       by a rapid transition she struck the g above the treble stave       springing over an interval of two octaves        upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal       execution she resumed her seat by my side when i expressed to       her in terms of the deepest enthusiasm my delight at her       performance of my surprise i said nothing and yet was i most       unfeignedly surprised for a certain feebleness or rather a       certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation       had prepared me to anticipate that in singing she would not       acquit herself with any remarkable ability        our conversation was now long earnest uninterrupted and       totally unreserved she made me relate many of the earlier       passages of my life and listened with breathless attention to       every word of the narrative i concealed nothingfelt that i had       a right to conceal nothingfrom her confiding affection       encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age i       entered with perfect frankness not only into a detail of my       many minor vices but made full confession of those moral and       even of those physical infirmities the disclosure of which in       demanding so much higher a degree of courage is so much surer an       evidence of love i touched upon my college indiscretionsupon my       extravagancesupon my carousalsupon my debtsupon my       flirtations i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic       cough with which at one time i had been troubledof a chronic       rheumatismof a twinge of hereditary goutand in conclusion of       the disagreeable and inconvenient but hitherto carefully       concealed weakness of my eyes        upon this latter point said madame lalande laughingly you       have been surely injudicious in coming to confession for       without the confession i take it for granted that no one would       have accused you of the crime by the by she continued have       you any recollection and here i fancied that a blush even       through the gloom of the apartment became distinctly visible       upon her cheekhave you any recollection mon cher ami of       this little ocular assistant which now depends from my neck        as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double       eyeglass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the       opera        full wellalas do i remember it i exclaimed pressing       passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my       inspection they formed a complex and magnificent toy richly       chased and filigreed and gleaming with jewels which even in       the deficient light i could not help perceiving were of high       value        eh bien mon ami she resumed with a certain empressment of       manner that rather surprised meeh bien mon ami you have       earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to       denominate priceless you have demanded of me my hand upon the       morrow should i yield to your entreatiesand i may add to the       pleadings of my own bosomwould i not be entitled to demand of       you a verya very little boon in return        name it i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon       us the observation of the company and restrained by their       presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet       name it my beloved my eugénie my ownname itbut alas it       is already yielded ere named        you shall conquer then mon ami said she for the sake of       the eugénie whom you love this little weakness which you have at       last confessedthis weakness more moral than physicaland which       let me assure you is so unbecoming the nobility of your real       natureso inconsistent with the candor of your usual       characterand which if permitted further control will assuredly       involve you sooner or later in some very disagreeable scrape       you shall conquer for my sake this affectation which leads you       as you yourself acknowledge to the tacit or implied denial of       your infirmity of vision for this infirmity you virtually deny       in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief you       will understand me to say then that i wish you to wear       spectaclesah hushyou have already consented to wear them       for my sake you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in       my hand and which though admirable as an aid to vision is       really of no very immense value as a gem you perceive that by a       trifling modification thusor thusit can be adapted to the eyes       in the form of spectacles or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an       eyeglass it is in the former mode however and habitually       that you have already consented to wear it for my sake        this requestmust i confess itconfused me in no little degree       but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation       of course a matter altogether out of the question        it is done i cried with all the enthusiasm that i could       muster at the moment it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i       sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear       eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the       earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of       calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there       wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less       fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which       you desire        our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements       for the morrow talbot i learned from my betrothed had just       arrived in town i was to see him at once and procure a       carriage the soirée would scarcely break up before two and by       this hour the vehicle was to be at the door when in the       confusion occasioned by the departure of the company madame l       could easily enter it unobserved we were then to call at the       house of a clergyman who would be in waiting there be married       drop talbot and proceed on a short tour to the east leaving the       fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the       matter it thought best        having planned all this i immediately took leave and went in       search of talbot but on the way i could not refrain from       stepping into a hotel for the purpose of inspecting the       miniature and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses the       countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one those large       luminous eyesthat proud grecian nosethose dark luxuriant       curlsah said i exultingly to myself this is indeed the       speaking image of my beloved i turned the reverse and       discovered the wordseugénie lalandeaged twentyseven years and       seven months        i found talbot at home and proceeded at once to acquaint him       with my good fortune he professed excessive astonishment of       course but congratulated me most cordially and proffered every       assistance in his power in a word we carried out our       arrangement to the letter and at two in the morning just ten       minutes after the ceremony i found myself in a close carriage       with madame lalandewith mrs simpson i should sayand driving       at a great rate out of town in a direction northeast by north       halfnorth        it had been determined for us by talbot that as we were to be       up all night we should make our first stop at c a village       about twenty miles from the city and there get an early       breakfast and some repose before proceeding upon our route at       four precisely therefore the carriage drew up at the door of       the principal inn i handed my adored wife out and ordered       breakfast forthwith in the meantime we were shown into a small       parlor and sat down        it was now nearly if not altogether daylight and as i gazed       enraptured at the angel by my side the singular idea came all       at once into my head that this was really the very first moment       since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame       lalande that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness       by daylight at all        and now mon ami said she taking my hand and so       interrupting this train of reflection and now mon cher ami       since we are indissolubly onesince i have yielded to your       passionate entreaties and performed my portion of our       agreementi presume you have not forgotten that you also have a       little favor to bestowa little promise which it is your       intention to keep ah let me see let me remember yes full       easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise       you made to eugénie last night listen you spoke thus it is       doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for       your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass       and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning       which gives me the privilege of calling you wife i will place it       upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the       less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more       serviceable form which you desire these were the exact words       my beloved husband were they not        they were i said you have an excellent memory and       assuredly my beautiful eugénie there is no disposition on my       part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply       see behold they are becomingratherare they not and here       having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles i       applied them gingerly in their proper position while madame       simpson adjusting her cap and folding her arms sat bolt       upright in her chair in a somewhat stiff and prim and indeed       in a somewhat undignified position        goodness gracious me i exclaimed almost at the very instant       that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nosemy       goodness gracious mewhy what can be the matter with these       glasses and taking them quickly off i wiped them carefully       with a silk handkerchief and adjusted them again        but if in the first instance there had occurred something which       occasioned me surprise in the second this surprise became       elevated into astonishment and this astonishment was       profoundwas extremeindeed i may say it was horrific what in       the name of everything hideous did this mean could i believe my       eyescould ithat was the question was thatwas thatwas that       rouge and were thoseand were thosewere those wrinkles upon       the visage of eugénie lalande and oh jupiter and every one of       the gods and goddesses little and bigwhatwhatwhatwhat had       become of her teeth i dashed the spectacles violently to the       ground and leaping to my feet stood erect in the middle of the       floor confronting mrs simpson with my arms set akimbo and       grinning and foaming but at the same time utterly speechless       with terror and with rage        now i have already said that madame eugénie lalandethat is to       say simpsonspoke the english language but very little better       than she wrote it and for this reason she very properly never       attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions but rage will       carry a lady to any extreme and in the present care it carried       mrs simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to       hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether       understand        vell monsieur said she after surveying me in great apparent       astonishment for some momentsvell monsieurand

had the effect of       working up mrs simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed       and as she made an end of it with great labor she jumped up       from her chair like somebody bewitched dropping upon the floor       an entire universe of bustle as she jumped once upon her feet       she gnashed her gums brandished her arms rolled up her sleeves       shook her fist in my face and concluded the performance by       tearing the cap from her head and with it an immense wig of the       most valuable and beautiful black hair the whole of which she       dashed upon the ground with a yell and there trammpled and       danced a fandango upon it in an absolute ecstasy and agony of       rage        meantime i sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated       moissart and voissart i repeated thoughtfully as she cut one       of her pigeonwings and croissart and froissart as she       completed anothermoissart and voissart and croissart and       napoleon bonaparte

great great grandmother       i wish i may be everlastingly confounded        madame eugénie lalande quasi simpsonformerly moissartwas in       sober fact my great great grandmother in her youth she had       been beautiful and even at eightytwo retained the majestic       height the sculptural contour of head the fine eyes and the       grecian nose of her girlhood by the aid of these of       pearlpowder of rouge of false hair false teeth and false       tournure as well as of the most skilful modistes of paris she       contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en       peu passées of the french metropolis in this respect indeed       she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the       celebrated ninon de lenclos        she was immensely wealthy and being left for the second time a       widow without children she bethought herself of my existence in       america and for the purpose of making me her heir paid a visit       to the united states in company with a distant and exceedingly       lovely relative of her second husbandsa madame stéphanie       lalande        at the opera my great great grandmothers attention was       arrested by my notice and upon surveying me through her       eyeglass she was struck with a certain family resemblance to       herself thus interested and knowing that the heir she sought       was actually in the city she made inquiries of her party       respecting me the gentleman who attended her knew my person and       told her who i was the information thus obtained induced her to       renew her scrutiny and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened       me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed she       returned my bow however under the impression that by some odd       accident i had discovered her identity when deceived by my       weakness of vision and the arts of the toilet in respect to the       age and charms of the strange lady i demanded so       enthusiastically of talbot who she was he concluded that i meant       the younger beauty as a matter of course and so informed me       with perfect truth that she was the celebrated widow madame       lalande        in the street next morning my great great grandmother       encountered talbot an old parisian acquaintance and the       conversation very naturally turned upon myself my deficiencies       of vision were then explained for these were notorious although       i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety and my good old       relative discovered much to her chagrin that she had been       deceived in supposing me aware of her identity and that i had       been merely making a fool of myself in making open love in a       theatre to an old woman unknown by way of punishing me for this       imprudence she concocted with talbot a plot he purposely kept       out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction my street       inquiries about the lovely widow madame lalande were supposed       to refer to the younger lady of course and thus the       conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly       after leaving talbots hotel will be easily explained as also       their allusion to ninon de lenclos i had no opportunity of       seeing madame lalande closely during daylight and at her       musical soirée my silly weakness in refusing the aid of       glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her       age when madame lalande was called upon to sing the younger       lady was intended and it was she who arose to obey the call my       great great grandmother to further the deception arising at       the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main       drawingroom had i decided upon escorting her thither it had       been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i       was but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary the       songs which i so much admired and which so confirmed my       impression of the youth of my mistress were executed by madame       stéphanie lalande the eyeglass was presented by way of adding a       reproof to the hoaxa sting to the epigram of the deception its       presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon       affectation with which i was so especially edified it is almost       superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument as worn by       the old lady had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted       to my years they suited me in fact to a t        the clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot was a       boon companion of talbots and no priest he was an excellent       whip however and having doffed his cassock to put on a       greatcoat he drove the hack which conveyed the happy couple       out of town talbot took a seat at his side the two scoundrels       were thus in at the death and through a halfopen window of       the back parlor of the inn amused themselves in grinning at the       dénouement of the drama i believe i shall be forced to call       them both out        nevertheless i am not the husband of my great great       grandmother and this is a reflection which affords me infinite       reliefbut i am the husband of madame lalandeof madame       stéphanie lalandewith whom my good old relative besides making       me her sole heir when she diesif she ever doeshas been at the       trouble of concocting me a match in conclusion i am done       forever with billets doux and am never to be met without       spectacles

these groups our two seamen formed i think the most       interesting if not the most conspicuous        the one who appeared to be the elder and whom his companion       addressed by the characteristic appellation of legs was at the       same time much the taller of the two he might have measured six       feet and a half and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to       have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so enormous       superfluities in height were however more than accounted for by       deficiencies in other respects he was exceedingly thin and       might as his associates asserted have answered when drunk for       a pennant at the masthead or when sober have served for a       jibboom but these jests and others of a similar nature had       evidently produced at no time any effect upon the cachinnatory       muscles of the tar with high cheekbones a large hawknose       retreating chin fallen underjaw and huge protruding white       eyes the expression of his countenance although tinged with a       species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general       was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts

supported his squat unwieldy figure       while his unusually short and thick arms with no ordinary fists       at their extremities swung off dangling from his sides like the       fins of a seaturtle small eyes of no particular color       twinkled far back in his head his nose remained buried in the       mass of flesh which enveloped his round full and purple face       and his thick upperlip rested upon the still thicker one beneath       with an air of complacent selfsatisfaction much heightened by       the owners habit of licking them at intervals he evidently       regarded

flagon of unpaidfor hummingstuff the       portentous words no chalk which to their indignation and       astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very       mineral whose presence

strict justice have been laid to the charge       of either disciple of the sea but there was to say the truth a       certain twist in the formation of the lettersan indescribable       leelurch about the wholewhich foreboded in the opinion of both       seamen a long run of dirty weather and determined them at once       in the allegorical words of legs himself to pump ship clew up       all sail and scud before the wind        having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale and       looped up the points of their short doublets they finally made a       bolt for the street

the barriers that locks bolts and secret cellars had       proved but slender protection to those rich stores of wines and       liquors which in consideration of the risk and trouble of       removal many of the numerous dealers having shops in the       neighbourhood had consented to trust during the period of exile       to so insufficient a security        but there were very few of the

pestilential atmosphere might be discerned lying in the bypaths       and alleys or rotting in the windowless habitations the carcass       of many a nocturnal plunderer arrested by the hand of the plague       in the very perpetration of his robbery        but it lay not in the power of images or sensations or       impediments such as these to stay the course of men who       naturally brave and at that time especially brimful of courage       and of hummingstuff would have reeled as straight as their       condition might have permitted undauntedly into the very jaws of       death onwardstill onward stalked the grim legs making the       desolate solemnity echo and reecho with yells like the terrific       warwhoop of the indian and onward still onward rolled the       dumpy tarpaulin hanging on to the doublet of his more active       companion and far surpassing the latters most strenuous       exertions in the way of vocal music by bullroarings in basso       from the profundity of his stentorian lungs        they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence       their way at every step or plunge grew more noisome and more       horriblethe paths more narrow and more intricate huge stones       and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them       gave evidence by their sullen and heavy descent of the vast       height of the surrounding houses and while actual exertion       became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of       rubbish it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a       skeleton or rested upon a more fleshly corpse        suddenly as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall       and ghastlylooking building a yell more than usually shrill       from the throat of the excited legs was replied to from within       in a rapid succession of wild laughterlike and fiendish       shrieks nothing daunted at sounds which of such a nature at       such a time and in such a place might have curdled the very       blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire the drunken couple       rushed headlong against the door burst it open and staggered       into the midst of things with a volley of curses        the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop       of an undertaker but an open trapdoor in a corner of the floor       near the entrance looked down upon a long range of winecellars       whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed       to be well stored with their appropriate contents in the middle       of the room stood a tablein the centre of which again arose a       huge tub of what appeared to be punch bottles of various wines       and cordials together with jugs pitchers and flagons of every       shape and quality were scattered profusely upon the board       around it upon coffintressels was seated a company of six       this company i will endeavor to delineate one by one        fronting the entrance and elevated a little above his       companions sat a personage who appeared to be the president of       the table his stature was gaunt and tall and legs was       confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself       his face was as yellow as saffronbut no feature excepting one       alone was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description       this one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously       lofty as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh       superadded upon the natural head his mouth was puckered and       dimpled into an expression of ghastly affability and his eyes       as indeed the eyes of all at table were glazed over with the       fumes of intoxication this gentleman was clothed from head to       foot in a richlyembroidered black silkvelvet pall wrapped       negligently around his form after the fashion of a spanish cloak       his head was stuck full of sable hearseplumes which he nodded       to and fro with a jaunty and knowing air and in his right hand       he held a huge human thighbone with which he appeared to have       been just knocking down some member of the company for a song        opposite him and with her back to the door was a lady of no       whit the less extraordinary character although quite as tall as       the person just described she had no right to complain of his       unnatural emaciation she was evidently in the last stage of a       dropsy and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon       of october beer which stood with the head driven in close by       her side in a corner of the chamber her face was exceedingly       round red and full and the same peculiarity or rather want of       peculiarity attached itself to her countenance which i before       mentioned in the case of the presidentthat is to say only one       feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a       separate characterization indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately       observed that the same remark might have applied to each       individual person of the party every one of whom seemed to       possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy       with the lady in question this portion proved to be the mouth       commencing at the right ear it swept with a terrific chasm to       the leftthe short pendants which she wore in either auricle       continually bobbing into the aperture she made however every       exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified in a dress       consisting of a newly starched and ironed shroud coming up close       under her chin with a crimpled ruffle of cambric muslin        at her right hand sat a diminutive young lady whom she appeared       to patronise this delicate little creature in the trembling of       her wasted fingers in the livid hue of her lips and in the       slight hectic spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion       gave evident indications of a galloping consumption an air of       extreme haut ton however pervaded her whole appearance she       wore in a graceful and dégagé manner a large and beautiful       windingsheet of the finest india lawn her hair hung in ringlets       over her neck a soft smile played about her mouth but her nose       extremely long thin sinuous flexible and pimpled hung down       far below her under lip and in spite of the delicate manner in       which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her       tongue gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression        over against her and upon the left of the dropsical lady was       seated a little puffy wheezing and gouty old man whose cheeks       reposed upon the shoulders of their owner like two huge bladders       of oporto wine with his arms folded and with one bandaged leg       deposited upon the table he seemed to think himself entitled to       some consideration he evidently prided himself much upon every       inch of his personal appearance but took more especial delight       in calling attention to his gaudycolored surtout this to say       the truth must have cost him no little money and was made to       fit him exceedingly wellbeing fashioned from one of the       curiously embroidered silken covers appertaining to those       glorious escutcheons which in england and elsewhere are       customarily hung up in some conspicuous place upon the       dwellings of departed aristocracy        next to him and at the right hand of the president was a       gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers his frame shook       in a ridiculous manner with a fit of what tarpaulin called the       horrors his jaws which had been newly shaved were tightly       tied up by a bandage of muslin and his arms being fastened in a       similar way at the wrists prevented him from helping himself too       freely to the liquors upon the table a precaution rendered       necessary in the opinion of legs by the peculiarly sottish and       winebibbing cast of his visage a pair of prodigious ears       nevertheless which it was no doubt found impossible to confine       towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment and were       occasionally pricked up in a spasm at the sound of the drawing       of a cork        fronting him sixthly and lastly was situated a singularly       stifflooking personage who being afflicted with paralysis       must to speak seriously have felt very ill at ease in his       unaccommodating habiliments he was habited somewhat uniquely       in a new and handsome mahogany coffin its top or headpiece       pressed upon the skull of the wearer and extended over it in the       fashion of a hood giving to the entire face an air of       indescribable interest armholes had been cut in the sides for       the sake not more of elegance than of convenience but the dress       nevertheless prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as       his associates and as he lay reclining against his tressel at       an angle of fortyfive degrees a pair of huge goggle eyes rolled       up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement       at their own enormity        before each of the party lay a portion of a skull which was used       as a drinking cup overhead was suspended a human skeleton by       means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring       in the ceiling the other limb confined by no such fetter stuck       off from the body at right angles causing the whole loose and       rattling frame to dangle and twirl about at the caprice of every       occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment       in the cranium of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited       charcoal which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire       scene while coffins and other wares appertaining to the shop of       an undertaker were piled high up around the room and against       the windows preventing any ray from escaping into the street        at sight of this extraordinary assembly and of their still more       extraordinary paraphernalia our two seamen did not conduct       themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been       expected legs leaning against the wall near which he happened       to be standing dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual and       spread open his eyes to their fullest extent while hugh       tarpaulin stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level       with the table and spreading out a palm upon either knee burst       into a long loud and obstreperous roar of very illtimed and       immoderate laughter        without however taking offence at behaviour so excessively       rude the tall president smiled very graciously upon the       intrudersnodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of       sable plumesand arising took each by an arm and led him to a       seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime       for his accommodation legs to all this offered not the slightest       resistance but sat down as he was directed while the gallant       hugh removing his coffin tressel from its station near the head       of the table to the vicinity of the little consumptive lady in       the winding sheet plumped down by her side in high glee and       pouring out a skull of red wine quaffed it to their better       acquaintance but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the       coffin seemed exceedingly nettled and serious consequences might       have ensued had not the president rapping upon the table with       his truncheon diverted the attention of all present to the       following speech        it becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion        avast there interrupted legs looking very serious avast       there a bit i say and tell us who the devil ye all are and       what business ye have here rigged off like the foul fiends and       swilling the snug blue ruin stowed away for the winter by my       honest shipmate will wimble the undertaker        at this unpardonable piece of illbreeding all the original       company half started to their feet and uttered the same rapid       succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the       attention of the seamen the president however was the first to       recover his composure and at length turning to legs with great       dignity recommenced        most willingly will we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the       part of guests so illustrious unbidden though they be know then       that in these dominions i am monarch and here rule with       undivided empire under the title of king pest the first        this apartment which you no doubt

in council we might be pardoned for replying       that it concerns and concerns alone our own private and regal       interest and is in no manner important to any other than       ourself but in consideration of those rights to which as guests       and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled we will       furthermore explain that we are here this night prepared by deep       research and accurate investigation to examine analyze and       thoroughly determine the indefinable spiritthe incomprehensible       qualities and natureof those inestimable treasures of the       palate the

dominions are unlimited and whose name is death        whose name is davy jones ejaculated tarpaulin helping the       lady by his side to a skull of liqueur and pouring out a second       for himself        profane varlet said the president now turning his attention       to the worthy hugh profane and execrable wretchwe have said       that in consideration of those rights which even in thy filthy       person we feel no inclination to violate we have condescended       to make reply to thy rude and unseasonable inquiries we       nevertheless for your unhallowed intrusion upon our councils       believe it our duty to mulct thee and thy companion in each a       gallon of black straphaving imbibed which to the prosperity of       our kingdomat a single draughtand upon your

      it would be a matter of utter impossibility replied legs whom       the assumptions and dignity of king pest the first had evidently       inspired some feelings of respect and who arose and steadied       himself by the table as he spokeit would please your majesty       be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even       onefourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just       mentioned to say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the       forenoon by way of ballast and not to mention the various ales       and liqueurs shipped this evening at different seaports i have       at present a full cargo of hummingstuff taken in and duly       paid for at the sign of the jolly tar you will therefore       please your majesty be so good as to take

find stowageroom for it myself but        this proceeding interposed the president is by no means in       accordance with the terms of the mulct or sentence which is in       its nature median and not to be altered or recalled the       conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter and       that without a moments hesitationin failure of which fulfilment       we decree that you do

lady of the winding       sheet waved her nose to and fro the gentleman in the cotton       drawers pricked up his ears she of the shroud gasped like a       dying fish and he of the coffin looked

treason treason shrieked her majesty of the mouth and       seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate       tarpaulin who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull       of liqueur she lifted him high into the air and let him fall       without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale       bobbing up and down for a few seconds like an apple in a bowl       of toddy he at length finally disappeared amid the whirlpool       of foam which in the already effervescent liquor his struggles       easily succeeded in creating        not tamely however did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture       of his companion jostling king pest through the open trap the       valiant legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath and       strode towards the centre of the room here tearing down the       skeleton which swung over the table he laid it about him with so       much energy and good will that as the last glimpses of light       died away within the apartment he succeeded in knocking out the       brains of the little gentleman with the gout rushing then with       all his force against the fatal hogshead full of october ale and       hugh tarpaulin he rolled it over and over in an instant out       burst a deluge of liquor so fierceso impetuousso       overwhelmingthat the room was flooded from wall to wallthe       loaded table

gentleman floated off in his coffinand the victorious legs       seizing by the waist the fat lady in the shroud rushed out with       her into the street and made a beeline for the free and easy

till then if i die for       it you know meim a man of my wordnow be off here he       swallowed his bumper of port while i rushed from the room in       despair        a very fine old english gentleman was my granduncle       rumgudgeon but unlike him of the song he had his weak points       he was a little pursy pompous passionate semicircular       somebody with a red nose a thick skull a long purse and a       strong sense of his own consequence with the best heart in the       world he contrived through a predominant whim of contradiction       to earn for himself among those who only knew him superficially       the character of a curmudgeon like many excellent people he       seemed possessed with a spirit of tantalization which might       easily at a casual glance have been mistaken for malevolence       to every request a positive no was his immediate answer but       in the endin the long long endthere were exceedingly few       requests which he refused against all attacks upon his purse he       made the most sturdy defence but the amount extorted from him       at last was generally in direct ratio with the length of the       siege and the stubbornness of the resistance in charity no one       gave more liberally or with a worse grace        for the fine arts and especially for the belleslettres he       entertained a profound contempt with this he had been inspired       by casimir perier whose pert little query a quoi un poete est       il bon he was in the habit of quoting with a very droll       pronunciation as the ne plus ultra of logical wit thus my own       inkling for the muses had excited his entire displeasure he       assured me one day when i asked him for a new copy of horace       that the translation of poeta nascitur non fit was a nasty       poet for nothing fita remark which i took in high dudgeon his       repugnance to the humanities had also much increased of late       by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural       science somebody had accosted him in the street mistaking him       for no less a personage than doctor dubble l dee the lecturer       upon quack physics this set him off at a tangent and just at       the epoch of this storyfor story it is getting to be after       allmy granduncle rumgudgeon was accessible and pacific only       upon points which happened to chime in with the caprioles of the       hobby he was riding for the rest he laughed with his arms and       legs and his politics were stubborn and easily understood he       thought with horsley that the people have nothing to do with       the laws but to obey them        i had lived with the old gentleman all my life my parents in       dying had bequeathed me to him as a rich legacy i believe the       old villain loved me as his own childnearly if not quite as well       as he loved katebut it was a dogs existence that he led me       after all from my first year until my fifth he obliged me with       very regular floggings from five to fifteen he threatened me       hourly with the house of correction from fifteen to twenty not       a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a       shilling i was a sad dog it is truebut then it was a part of       my naturea point of my faith in kate however i had a firm       friend and i knew it she was a good girl and told me very       sweetly that i might have her plum and all whenever i could       badger my granduncle rumgudgeon into the necessary consent       poor girlshe was barely fifteen and without this consent her       little amount in the funds was not comeatable until five       immeasurable summers had dragged their slow length along what       then to do at fifteen or even at twentyone for i had now       passed my fifth olympiad five years in prospect are very much       the same as five hundred in vain we besieged the old gentleman       with importunities here was a piece de resistance as messieurs       ude and careme would say which suited his perverse fancy to a t       it would have stiffed the indignation of job himself to see how       much like an old mouser he behaved to us two poor wretched little       mice in his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our       union he had made up his mind to this all along in fact he       would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket kates       plum was her own if he could have invented any thing like an       excuse for complying with our very natural wishes but then we       had been so imprudent as to broach the subject ourselves not to       oppose it under such circumstances i sincerely believe was not       in his power        i have said already that he had his weak points but in speaking       of these i must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy       which was one of his strong pointsassurement ce n etait pas sa       foible when i mention his weakness i have allusion to a bizarre       oldwomanish superstition which beset him he was great in       dreams portents et id genus omne of rigmarole he was       excessively punctilious too upon small points of honor and       after his own fashion was a man of his word beyond doubt this       was in fact one of his hobbies the spirit of his vows he made       no scruple of setting at naught but the letter was a bond       inviolable now it was this latter peculiarity in his       disposition of which kates ingenuity enabled us one fine day       not long after our interview in the diningroom to take a very       unexpected advantage and having thus in the fashion of all       modern bards and orators exhausted in prolegomena all the time       at my command and nearly all the room at my disposal i will sum       up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story        it happened thenso the fates ordered itthat among the naval       acquaintances of my betrothed were two gentlemen who had just       set foot upon the shores of england after a years absence       each in foreign travel in company with these gentlemen my       cousin and i preconcertedly paid uncle rumgudgeon a visit on the       afternoon of sunday october the tenthjust three weeks after       the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes       for about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics       but at last we contrived quite naturally to give it the       following turn        capt pratt well i have been absent just one yearjust one       year today as i livelet me see yesthis is october the       tenth you remember mr rumgudgeon i called this day year to       bid you goodbye and by the way it does seem something like a       coincidence does it notthat our friend captain smitherton       here has been absent exactly a year alsoa year today        smitherton yes just one year to a fraction you will remember       mr rumgudgeon that i called with capt pratol on this very day       last year to pay my parting respects        uncle yes yes yesi remember it very wellvery queer indeed       both of you gone just one year a very strange coincidence       indeed just what doctor dubble l dee would denominate an       extraordinary concurrence of events doctor dub        kate interrupting to be sure papa it is something strange       but then captain pratt and captain smitherton didnt go       altogether the same route and that makes a difference you       know        uncle i dont know any such thing you huzzy how should i i       think it only makes the matter more remarkable doctor dubble l       dee        kate why papa captain pratt went round cape horn and captain       smitherton doubled the cape of good hope        uncle preciselythe one went east and the other went west you       jade and they both have gone quite round the world by the by       doctor dubble l dee        myself hurriedly captain pratt you must come and spend the       evening with us tomorrowyou and smithertonyou can tell us all       about your voyage and well have a game of whist and        pratt wist my dear fellowyou forget tomorrow will be       sunday some other evening        kate oh no fieroberts not quite so bad as that todays       sunday        pratt i beg both your pardonsbut i cant be so much mistaken       i know tomorrows sunday because        smitherton much surprised what are you all thinking about       wasnt yesterday sunday i should like to know        all yesterday indeed you are out        uncle todays sunday i saydont i know        pratt oh notomorrows sunday        smitherton you are all madevery one of you i am as positive       that yesterday was sunday as i am that i sit upon this chair        kate jumping up eagerly i see iti see it all papa this is       a judgment upon you aboutabout you know what let me alone and       ill explain it all in a minute its a very simple thing       indeed captain smitherton says that yesterday was sunday so it       was he is right cousin bobby and uncle and i say that today       is sunday so it is we are right captain pratt maintains that       tomorrow will be sunday so it will he is right too the fact       is we are all right and thus three sundays have come together       in a week        smitherton after a pause by the by pratt kate has us       completely what fools we two are mr rumgudgeon the matter       stands thus the earth you know is twentyfour thousand miles       in circumference now this globe of the earth turns upon its own       axisrevolvesspins roundthese twentyfour thousand miles of       extent going from west to east in precisely twentyfour hours       do you understand mr rumgudgeon        uncle to be sureto be suredoctor dub        smitherton drowning his voice well sir that is at the rate       of one thousand miles per hour now suppose that i sail from       this position a thousand miles east of course i anticipate the       rising of the sun here at london by just one hour i see the sun       rise one hour before you do proceeding in the same direction       yet another thousand miles i anticipate the rising by two       hoursanother thousand and i anticipate it by three hours and       so on until i go entirely round the globe and back to this       spot when having gone twentyfour thousand miles east i       anticipate the rising of the london sun by no less than       twentyfour hours that is to say i am a day in advance of your       time understand eh        uncle but double l dee        smitherton speaking very loud captain pratt on the       contrary when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this       position was an hour and when he had sailed twentyfour       thousand miles west was twentyfour hours or one day behind       the time at london thus with me yesterday was sundaythus       with you today is sundayand thus with pratt tomorrow will       be sunday and what is more mr rumgudgeon it is positively       clear that we are all right for there can be no philosophical       reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference       over that of the other        uncle my eyeswell katewell bobbythis is a judgment upon       me as you say but i am a man of my wordmark that you shall       have her boy plum and all when you please done up by jove       three
