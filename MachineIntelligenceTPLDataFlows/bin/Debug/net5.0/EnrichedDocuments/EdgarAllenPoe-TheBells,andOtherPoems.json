Hear the sledges with the bells--               Silver bells! What a world of merriment their melody foretells!        How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,            In the icy air of night!        While the stars, that oversprinkle        All the heavens, seem to twinkle            With  a crystalline delight;        Keeping time, time, time,        In a sort if Runic rhyme, To the tintinabulation that so musically wells     From the bells, bells, bells, bells,            Bells, bells, bells,-- From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.                        II.         Hear the mellow wedding bells,               Golden bells! What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!        Through the balmy air of night        How they ring out their delight!          From the molten golden-notes,              And all in tune,            What a liquid ditty floats To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats                 On the moon!        Oh, from out the sounding cells, What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!                 How it swells!                 How it dwells          On the Future! how it tells          Of the rapture that impels      To the swinging and the ringing        Of the bells, bells, bells,      Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,              Bells, bells, bells-- To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!   [Illustration: The Bells]                        III.         Hear the loud alarum bells--                Brazen bells! What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!     In the startled ear of night     How they scream out their affright!       Too much horrified to speak       They can only shriek, shriek,              Out of tune, In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,           Leaping higher, higher, higher,           With a desperate desire,        And a resolute endeavour.        Now--now to sit or never,      By the side of the pale-faced moon.           Oh, the bells, bells, bells!           What a tale their terror tells               Of Despair!      How they clang, and clash, and roar!      What a horror they outpour      On the bosom of the palpitating air!             Yet the ear it fully knows,               By the twanging,               And the clanging,             How the danger ebbs and flows:           Yet the ear distinctly tells,               In the jangling,               And the wrangling,           How the danger sinks and swells, By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--                  Of the bells--           Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,               Bells, bells, bells-- In the clamour and the clangour of the bells!                        IV.         Hear the tolling of the bells--               Iron bells! What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!        In the silence of the night,        How we shiver with affright      At the melancholy menace of their tone!        For every sound that floats        From the rust within their throats               Is a groan.        And the people--ah, the people--        They that dwell up in the steeple,               All alone,        And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,           In that muffled monotone,        Feel a glory in so rolling           On the human heart a stone--        They are neither man nor woman--        They are neither brute nor human--                They are Ghouls:           And their king it is who tolls;           And he rolls, rolls, rolls,               Rolls             A paean from the bells!        And his merry bosom swells           With the paean of the bells!        And he dances, and he yells;        Keeping time, time, time,        In a sort of Runic rhyme,           To the paean of the bells--               Of the bells:        Keeping time, time, time,        In a sort of Runic rhyme,           To the throbbing of the bells        Of the bells, bells, bells--           To the sobbing of the bells;        Keeping time, time, time,           As he knells, knells, knells,        In a happy Runic rhyme,           To the rolling of the bells--        Of the bells, bells, bells:           To the tolling of the bells,        Of the bells, bells, bells, bells--           Bells, bells, bells--    To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.       _EULALIE--A SONG_                I dwelt alone              In a world of moan,    And my soul was a stagnant tide, Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride-- Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.               Ah, less--less bright              The stars of the night    Than the eyes of the radiant girl!              And never a flake              That the vapour can make    With the moon-tints of purple and pearl, Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl-- Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie’s most humble and careless       curl.               Now doubt--now Pain              Come never again,    For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,              And all day long              Shines, bright and strong,    Astarté within the sky, While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye-- While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.  [Illustration: Annabel Lee]       _ANNABEL LEE_   It was many and many a year ago,      In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know      By the name of ANNABEL LEE; And this maiden she lived with no other thought      Than to love and be loved by me.  I was a child and _she_ was a child,      In this kingdom by the sea; But we loved with a love which was more than love--      I and my Annabel Lee; With a love that the wingèd seraphs of heaven      Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,      In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kinsmen came      And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulchre      In this kingdom by the sea.  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,      Went envying her and me-- Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,      In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night,      Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love      Of those who were older than we--      Of many far wiser than we-- And neither the angels in heaven above,      Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes      Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,      In her sepulchre there by the sea,      In her tomb by the sounding sea.       _SONNET--SILENCE_   There are some qualities--some incorporate things,   That have a double life, which thus is made A type of that twin entity which springs   From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade. There is a two-fold _Silence_--sea and shore--   Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,   Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces, Some human memories and tearful lore, Render him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\" He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!   No power hath he of evil in himself; But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)   Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf, That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod No foot of man), commend thyself to God!  [Illustration: Silence]       _THE RAVEN_   Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--             Only this, and nothing more.\"  Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December, And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore-- For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--             Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-- Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--             This it is, and nothing more.\"  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, That I scarce was sure I heard you,\"--here I opened wide the door;--             Darkness there, and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,       fearing, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--             Merely this, and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice: Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-- Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--             'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--             Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no       craven, Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"             Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore; For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-- Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,             With such name as \"Nevermore.\"  But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered-- Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"other friends have flown       before-- On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"             Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store, Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-- Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore             Of 'Never--nevermore'.\"  But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and       door; Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-- What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore             Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core; This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er, But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,             _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor. \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath       sent thee Respite--respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore! Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!\"             Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or       devil!-- Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-- On this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore-- Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"             Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore-- Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn, It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-- Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"             Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,\" I shrieked,       upstarting-- \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"             Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor             Shall be lifted--nevermore!  [Illustration: The Raven]       _TO ONE IN PARADISE_   Thou wast all that to me, love,   For which my soul did pine-- A green isle in the sea, love,   A fountain and a shrine, All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,   And all the flowers were mine.  Ah, dream to bright to last!   Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise But to be overcast!   A voice from out the Future cries, \"On! on!\"--but o'er the Past   (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies Mute, motionless, aghast!  For, alas! alas! with me   The light of Life is o'er! \"No more--no more--no more--\" (Such language holds the solemn sea   To the sands upon the shore) Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree   Or the stricken eagle soar!  And all my days are trances,   And all my nightly dreams Are where thy grey eye glances,   And where thy footstep gleams-- In what ethereal dances,   By what eternal streams.  [Illustration: To One in Paradise]       _LENORE_   Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever! Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river; And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or nevermore! See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore! Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!-- An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young-- A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.  \"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride. And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died! How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"  [Illustration: Lenore]  _Peccavimus_; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong The sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside, Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy       bride-- For her, the fair and _debonair_, that now so lowly lies, The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes-- The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.  \"Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-- From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven-- From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of Heaven! Let no bell toll, then,--lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth, Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damnèd Earth! And I!--to-night my heart is light!--no dirge will I upraise, But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!\"       _DREAMS_   Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream! My spirit not awakening, till the beam Of an Eternity should bring the morrow. Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow, 'Twere better than the cold reality Of waking life, to him whose heart must be, And hath been still, upon the lovely earth, A chaos of deep passion, from his birth. But should it be--that dream eternally Continuing--as dreams have been to me In my young boyhood--should it thus be given, 'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven. For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light And loveliness,--have left my very heart In climes of my imagining, apart From mine own home, with beings that have been Of mine own thought--what more could I have seen? 'Twas once--and only once--and the wild hour From my remembrance shall not pass--some power Or spell had bound me--'twas the chilly wind Came o'er me in the night, and left behind Its image on my spirit--or the moon Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon Too coldly--or the stars--howe'er it was That dream was as that night-wind--let it pass. I _have been_ happy, tho' in a dream. I have been happy--and I love the theme: Dreams! in their vivid colouring of life, As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife Of semblance with reality, which brings To the delirious eye, more lovely things Of Paradise and Love--and all our own! Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.       _TO HELEN_  [Helen was Mrs. Whitman.]   I saw thee once--once only--years ago: I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many. It was a July midnight; and from out A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven, There fell a silvery-silken veil of light, With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, Upon the upturned faces of a thousand Roses that grew in an enchanted garden, Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-- Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses That gave out, in return for the love-light, Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-- Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses, And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-- Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,) That bade me pause before that garden-gate, To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept, Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!--oh, God How my heart beats in coupling those two words!) Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked-- And in an instant all things disappeared. (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)  The pearly lustre of the moon went out: The mossy banks and the meandering paths, The happy flowers and the repining trees, Were seen no more: the very roses' odours Died in the arms of the adoring airs. All--all expired save thee--save less than thou: Save only the divine light in thine eyes-- Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. I saw but them--they were the world to me! I saw but them--saw only them for hours, Saw only them until the moon went down. What wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!  [Illustration: To Helen]  How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope! How silently serene a sea of pride! How daring an ambition; yet how deep-- How fathomless a capacity for love!  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight, Into a western couch of thunder-cloud; And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained;_ They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone; Lighting my lonely pathway home that night, _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since; They follow me--they lead me through the years. They are my ministers--yet I their slave. Their office is to illumine and enkindle-- My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light, And purified in their electric fire, And sanctified in their elysian fire. They fill, my soul with Beauty (which is Hope), And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to In the sad, silent watches of my night; While even in the meridian glare of day I see them still--two sweetly scintillant Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!       _THE HAUNTED PALACE_   In the greenest of our valleys   By good angels tenanted, Once a fair and stately palace--   Radiant palace--reared its head. In the monarch Thought's dominion--   It stood there! Never seraph spread a pinion   Over fabric half so fair!  Banners yellow, glorious, golden,   On its roof did float and flow, (This--all this--was in the olden   Time long ago,) And every gentle air that dallied,   In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,   A wingèd odour went away.  Wanderers in that happy valley,   Through two luminous windows, saw Spirits moving musically,   To a lute's well-tuned law, Round about a throne where, sitting   (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well befitting,   The ruler of the realm was seen.  And all with pearl and ruby glowing   Was the fair palace door, Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,   And sparkling evermore, A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty   Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty,   The wit and wisdom of their king.  [Illustration: The Haunted Palace]  But evil things, in robes of sorrow,   Assailed the monarch's high estate. (Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow   Shall dawn upon him desolate!) And round about his home the glory   That blushed and bloomed, Is but a dim-remembered story   Of the old time entombed.  And travellers, now, within that valley,   Through the red-litten windows see Vast forms, that move fantastically   To a discordant melody, While, like a ghastly rapid river,   Through the pale door A hideous throng rush out for ever   And laugh--but smile no more.       _A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM_   Take this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow-- You are not wrong, who deem That my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away In a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less _gone?_ _All_ that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand-- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep--while I weep! O God! can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! can I not save _One_ from the pitiless wave? Is _all_ that we see or seem But a dream within a dream?       _THE CITY IN THE SEA_   Lo! Death has reared himself a throne In a strange city lying alone Far down within the dim West, Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best Have gone to their eternal rest. There shrines and palaces and towers (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!) Resemble nothing that is ours. Around, by lifting winds forgot, Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie.  No rays from the holy heaven come down On the long night-time of that town; But light from out the lurid sea Streams up the turrets silently-- Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-- Up domes--up spires--up kingly halls-- Up fanes--up Babylon-like walls-- Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-- Up many and many a marvellous shrine Whose wreathèd friezes intertwine The viol, the violet, and the vine. Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie. So blend the turrets and shadows there That all seem pendulous in air, While from a proud tower in the town Death looks gigantically down.  [Illustration: The City in the Sea]  There open fanes and gaping graves Yawn level with the luminous waves; But not the riches there that lie In each idol's diamond eye-- Not the gaily-jewelled dead Tempt the waters from their bed; For no ripples curl, alas! Along that wilderness of glass-- No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far-off happier sea-- No heavings hint that winds have been On seas less hideously serene.  But lo, a stir is in the air! The wave--there is a movement there! As if the towers had thrust aside, In slightly sinking, the dull tide-- As if their tops had feebly given A void within the filmy Heaven. The waves have now a redder glow-- The hours are breathing faint and low-- And when, amid no earthly moans, Down, down that town shall settle hence, Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, Shall do it reverence.       _TO F----_  [F---- is, presumably, Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood]   Beloved! amid the earnest woes   That crowd around my earthly path-- (Drear path, alas! where grows Not even one lonely rose)--   My soul at least a solace hath In dreams of thee, and therein knows An Eden of bland repose.  And thus thy memory is to me   Like some enchanted far-off isle In some tumultuous sea-- Some ocean throbbing far and free   With storms--but where meanwhile Serenest skies continually   Just o'er that one bright island smile.       _THE SLEEPER_   At midnight, in the month of June, I stand beneath the mystic moon. An opiate vapour, dewy, dim, Exhales from out her golden rim, And, softly dripping, drop by drop, Upon the quiet mountain top, Steals drowsily and musically Into the universal valley. The rosemary nods upon the grave; The lily lolls upon the wave; Wrapping the fog about its breast, The ruin moulders into rest; Looking like Lethe, see! the lake A conscious slumber seems to take, And would not, for the world, awake. All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies Irene, with her Destinies!  [Illustration: The Sleeper]  O, lady bright! can it be right-- This window open to the night? The wanton airs, from the tree-top, Laughingly through the lattice drop-- The bodiless airs, a wizard rout, Flit through thy chamber in and out, And wave the curtain canopy So fitfully--so fearfully-- Above the closed and fringèd lid \"Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid, That, o'er the floor and down the wall, Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall! Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear? Why and what art thou dreaming here? Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas, A wonder to these garden trees! Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress, Strange, above all, thy length of tress, And this all solemn silentness!  The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, Which is enduring, so be deep! Heaven have her in its sacred keep! This chamber changed for one more holy, This bed for one more melancholy, I pray to God that she may lie For ever with unopened eye, While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!  My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep As it is lasting, so be deep! Soft may the worms about her creep! Far in the forest, dim and old, For her may some tall vault unfold-- Some vault that oft has flung its black And wingèd panels fluttering back, Triumphant, o'er the crested palls, Of her grand family funerals-- Some sepulchre, remote, alone, Against whose portal she hath thrown, In childhood, many an idle stone-- Some tomb from out whose sounding door She ne'er shall force an echo more, Thrilling to think, poor child of sin! It was the dead who groaned within.       _ULALUME_   The skies they were ashen and sober;      The leaves they were crisped and sere--      The leaves they were withering and sere; It was night in the lonesome October      Of my most immemorial year; It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,      In the misty mid region of Weir-- It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,      In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.  Here once, through an alley Titanic,      Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--      Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul. These were days when my heart was volcanic      As the scoriac rivers that roll--      As the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek      In the ultimate climes of the pole-- That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek      In the realms of the boreal pole.  [Illustration: Ulalume]  Our talk had been serious and sober,      But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--      Our memories were treacherous and sere-- For we knew not the month was October,      And we marked not the night of the year--      (Ah, night of all nights in the year!) We noted not the dim lake of Auber--      (Though once we had journeyed down here), Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,      Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir. And now, as the night was senescent,      And star-dials pointed to morn--      As the star-dials hinted of morn-- At the end of our path a liquescent      And nebulous lustre was born, Out of which a miraculous crescent      Arose with a duplicate horn-- Astarte's bediamonded crescent      Distinct with its duplicate horn.  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:      She rolls through an ether of sighs--      She revels in a region of sighs: She has seen that the tears are not dry on      These cheeks, where the worm never dies, And has come past the stars of the Lion,      To point us the path to the skies--      To the Lethean peace of the skies-- Come up, in despite of the Lion,      To shine on us with her bright eyes-- Come up through the lair of the Lion,      With love in her luminous eyes.\"  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,      Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--      Her pallor I strangely mistrust:-- Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!      Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\" In terror she spoke, letting sink her      Wings until they trailed in the dust-- In agony sobbed, letting sink her      Plumes till they trailed in the dust--      Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:      Let us on by this tremulous light!      Let us bathe in this crystalline light! Its Sybilic splendour is beaming      With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--      See!--it flickers up the sky through the night! Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,      And be sure it will lead us aright-- We safely may trust to a gleaming      That cannot but guide us aright,      Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"   Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,      And tempted her out of her gloom--      And conquered her scruples and gloom; And we passed to the end of the vista,      But were stopped by the door of a tomb--      By the door of a legended tomb; And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,      On the door of this legended tomb?\"      She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--      'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"   Then my heart it grew ashen and sober      As the leaves that were crisped and sere--      As the leaves that were withering and sere; And I cried--\"It was surely October      On _this_ very night of last year      That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--      That I brought a dread burden down here--      On this night of all nights in the year,      Ah, what demon has tempted me here? Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--      This misty mid region of Weir-- Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,      This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"       _ROMANCE_   Romance, who loves to nod and sing, With drowsy head and folded wing, Among the green leaves as they shake Far down within some shadowy lake, To me a painted paroquet Hath been--a most familiar bird-- Taught me my alphabet to say-- To lisp my very earliest word While in the wild wood I did lie, A child--with a most knowing eye.  Of late, eternal Condor years So shake the very Heaven on high With tumult as they thunder by, I have no time for idle cares Through gazing on the unquiet sky. And when an hour with calmer wings Its down upon my spirit flings-- That little time with lyre and rhyme To while away--forbidden things! My heart would feel to be a crime Unless it trembled with the strings.       _SONNET--TO SCIENCE_   Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!   Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes. Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,   Vulture, whose wings are dull realities? How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,   Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,   Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing? Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?   And driven the Hamadryad from the wood To seek a shelter in some happier star?   Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood, The Elfin from the green grass, and from me The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?       _ELDORADO_       Gaily bedight,     A gallant knight. In sunshine and in shadow,     Had journeyed long,     Singing a song, In search of Eldorado.      But he grew old--     This knight so bold-- And o'er his heart a shadow     Fell as he found     No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado.      And, as his strength     Failed him at length, He met a pilgrim shadow--     \"Shadow,\" said he,     \"Where can it be-- This land of Eldorado?\"  [Illustration: Eldorado]      \"Over the Mountains     Of the Moon, Down the Valley of the Shadow,     Ride, boldly ride,\"     The shade replied-- \"If you seek for Eldorado!\"       _TO M----_   O! I care not that my earthly lot   Hath little of Earth in it, That years of love have been forgot   In the fever of a minute:  I heed not that the desolate   Are happier, sweet, than I, But that you meddle with my fate   Who am a passer by.  It _is_ not that my founts of bliss   Are gushing--strange! with tears-- Or that the thrill of a single kiss   Hath palsied many years--  'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs   Which have wither'd as they rose Lie dead on my heart-strings   With the weight of an age of snows.  Not that the grass--O! may it thrive!   On my grave is growing or grown-- But that, while I am dead yet alive   I cannot be, lady, alone.       _THE CONQUEROR WORM_   Lo! 'tis a gala night   Within the lonesome latter years! An angel throng, bewinged, bedight   In veils, and drowned in tears, Sit in a theatre, to see   A play of hopes and fears, While the orchestra breathes fitfully   The music of the spheres.  Mimes, in the form of God on high,   Mutter and mumble low, And hither and thither fly--   Mere puppets they, who come and go At bidding of vast formless things   That shift the scenery to and fro, Flapping from out their Condor wings   Invisible Woe!  That motley drama--oh, be sure   It shall not be forgot! With its Phantom chased for evermore,   By a crowd that seize it not, Through a circle that ever returneth in   To the self-same spot, And much of Madness, and more of Sin,   And Horror the soul of the plot.  But see, amid the mimic rout   A crawling shape intrude! A blood-red thing that writhes from out   The scenic solitude! It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs   The mimes become its food, And seraphs sob at vermin fangs   In human gore imbued.  Out--out are the lights--out all!   And, over each quivering form, The curtain, a funeral pall,   Comes down with the rush of a storm While the angels, all pallid and wan,   Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"   And its hero the Conqueror Worm.  [Illustration: The Conqueror Worm]       _SONNET--TO ZANTE_   Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,   Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take! How many memories of what radiant hours   At sight of thee and thine at once awake! How many scenes of what departed bliss!   How many thoughts of what entombed hopes! How many visions of a maiden that is   No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes! _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound   Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_-- Thy memory _no more!_ Accursèd ground   Henceforth I hold thy flower-enamelled shore, O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!   \"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!\"       _TO M. L. S.----_  [Mrs. Marie Louise Shew.]   Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-- Of all to whom thine absence is the night-- The blotting utterly from out high heaven The sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee Hourly for hope--for life--ah! above all, For the resurrection of deep-buried faith In Truth--in Virtue--in Humanity-- Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen At thy soft-murmured words, \"Let there be light!\" At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-- Of all who owe thee most--whose gratitude Nearest resembles worship--oh, remember The truest--the most fervently devoted, And think that these weak lines are written by him-- By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think His spirit is communing with an angel's.       _TO THE RIVER ----_  Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow   Of crystal, wandering water, Thou art an emblem of the glow         Of beauty--the unhidden heart--         The playful maziness of art   In old Alberto's daughter;  But when within thy wave she looks--   Which glistens then, and trembles-- Why, then, the prettiest of brooks   Her worshipper resembles; For in my heart, as in thy stream,   Her image deeply lies-- His heart which trembles at the beam  Of her soul-searching eyes.  [Illustration: To the river]       _A DREAM_   In visions of the dark night   I have dreamed of joy departed-- But a waking dream of life and light   Hath left me broken-hearted.  Ah! what is not a dream by day   To him whose eyes are cast On things around him with a ray   Turned back upon the past?  That holy dream--that holy dream,   While all the world were chiding, Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,   A lonely spirit guiding.  What though that light, thro' storm and night,   So trembled from afar-- What could there be more purely bright   In Truth's day-star?       _AL AARAAF_   PART I.  O! nothing earthly save the ray (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye, As in those gardens where the day Springs from the gems of Circassy-- O! nothing earthly save the thrill Of melody in woodland rill-- Or (music of the passion-hearted) Joy's voice so peacefully departed That like the murmur in the shell. Its echo dwelleth and will dwell-- Oh, nothing of the dross of ours-- Yet all the beauty--all the flowers That list our Love, and deck our bowers-- Adorn yon world afar, afar-- The wandering star.    'Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there Her world lay lolling on the golden air, Near four bright suns--a temporary rest-- An oasis in desert of the blest. Away--away--'mid seas of rays that roll Empyrean splendour o'er th' unchained soul-- The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense) Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,-- To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode And late to ours, the favour'd one of God-- But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm, She throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm, And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns, Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.  Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth, Whence sprang the \"Idea of Beauty\" into birth, (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star, Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar, It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt) She looked into Infinity--and knelt. Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-- Fit emblems of the model of her world-- Seen but in beauty--not impeding sight Of other beauty glittering thro' the light-- A wreath that twined each starry form around, And all the opal'd air in colour bound.    All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang So eagerly around about to hang Upon the flying footsteps of----deep pride-- Of her who lov'd a mortal--and so died. The Sephalica, budding with young bees, Upreared its purple stem around her knees:-- And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd-- Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd All other loveliness:--its honied dew (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew) Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven. And fell on gardens of the unforgiven In Trebizond--and on a sunny flower So like its own above that, to this hour, It still remaineth, torturing the bee With madness, and unwonted reverie: In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf And blossom of the fairy plant in grief Disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head, Repenting follies that full long have fled, Heaving her white breast to the balmy air, Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair: Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light She fears to perfume, perfuming the night: And Clytia, pondering between many a sun, While pettish tears adown her petals run: And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth, And died, ere scarce exalted into birth, Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king: And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown From struggling with the waters of the Rhone: And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante! Isola d'oro!--Fior di Levante! And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever With Indian Cupid down the holy river-- Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given To bear the Goddess' song, in odours, up to Heaven      \"Spirit! thou dwellest where,       In the deep sky,     The terrible and fair,       In beauty vie!     Beyond the line of blue--       The boundary of the star     Which turneth at the view       Of thy barrier and thy bar--     Of the barrier overgone       By the comets who were cast     From their pride and from their throne       To be drudges till the last--     To be carriers of fire       (The red fire of their heart)     With speed that may not tire       And with pain that shall not part--     Who livest--_that_ we know--       In Eternity--we feel--     But the shadow of whose brow       What spirit shall reveal?     Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,       Thy messenger hath known     Have dream'd for thy Infinity       A model of their own--     Thy will is done, O God!       The star hath ridden high     Thro' many a tempest, but she rode       Beneath thy burning eye;     And here, in thought, to thee--       In thought that can alone     Ascend thy empire and so be       A partner of thy throne--     By wingèd Fantasy,       My embassy is given,     Till secrecy shall knowledge be      In the environs of Heaven.\"  She ceas'd--and buried then her burning cheek Abash'd, amid the lilies there, too seek A shelter from the fervour of His eye; For the stars trembled at the Deity. She stirr'd not--breath'd not--for a voice was there How solemnly pervading the calm air! A sound of silence on the startled ear Which dreamy poets name \"the music of the sphere.\"  Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call \"Silence\"--which is the merest word of all. All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings-- But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high The eternal voice of God is passing by, And the red winds are withering in the sky:--    \"What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run Linked to a little system, and one sun-- Where all my life is folly and the crowd Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud, The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath-- (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?) What tho' in world which hold a single sun The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run, Yet thine is my resplendency, so given To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly, With all thy train, athwart the moony sky-- Apart--like fire-flies in the Sicilian night, And wing to other worlds another light! Divulge the secrets of thy embassy To the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!\"    Up rose the maiden in the yellow night, The single-moonèd eve!--on Earth we plight Our faith to one love--and one moon adore-- The birth-place of young Beauty had no more. As sprang that yellow star from downy hours Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers, And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign.   PART II.  High on a mountain of enamell'd head-- Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed Of giant pasturage lying at his ease, Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees With many a mutter'd \"hope to be forgiven\" What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven-- Of Rosy head that, towering far away Into the sunlight ether, caught the ray Of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night, While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air, Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile Far down upon the wave that sparkled there, And nursled the young mountain in its lair. Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall Of their own dissolution, while they die-- Adorning then the dwellings of the sky. A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down, Sat gently on these columns as a crown-- A window of one circular diamond, there, Look'd out above into the purple air, And rays from God shot down that meteor chain And hallow'd all the beauty twice again, Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring, Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing. But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen The dimness of this world: that greyish green That Nature love's the best for Beauty's grave Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave-- And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout That from his marble dwelling peerèd out, Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche-- Achaian statues in a world so rich? Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis-- From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave Is now upon thee--but too late to save!    Sound loves to revel in a summer night: Witness the murmur of the grey twilight That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco, Of many a wild star-gazer long ago-- That stealeth ever on the ear of him Who, musing, gazeth on the distant dim, And sees the darkness coming as a cloud-- Is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?    But what is this?--it cometh, and it brings A music with it--'tis the rush of wings-- A pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain And Nesace is in her halls again. From the wild energy of wanton haste   Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart; And zone that clung around her gentle waist   Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart. Within the centre of that hall to breathe, She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath, The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.     Young flowers were whispering in melody To happy flowers that night--and tree to tree; Fountains were gushing music as they fell In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell; Yet silence came upon material things-- Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-- And sound alone that from the spirit sprang Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:      \"'Neath the blue-bell or streamer--       Or tufted wild spray     That keeps, from the dreamer,       The moonbeam away--     Bright beings! that ponder,       With half closing eyes,     On the stars which your wonder       Hath drawn from the skies,     Till they glance thro' the shade, and       Come down to your brow     Like----eyes of the maiden       Who calls on you now--     Arise! from your dreaming       In violet bowers,     To duty beseeming       These star-litten hours--     And shake from your tresses       Encumber'd with dew     The breath of those kisses       That cumber them too--     (O! how, without you, Love!       Could angels be blest?)     Those kisses of true Love       That lull'd ye to rest!     Up!--shake from your wing       Each hindering thing:     The dew of the night--       It would weigh down your flight;     And true love caresses--       O, leave them apart!     They are light on the tresses,       But lead on the heart.  [Illustration: Al Aaraaf]      Ligeia! Ligeia!       My beautiful one!     Whose harshest idea       Will to melody run,     O! is it thy will       On the breezes to toss?     Or, capriciously still,       Like the lone Albatross,     Incumbent on night       (As she on the air)     To keep watch with delight       On the harmony there?      Ligeia! wherever       Thy image may be,     No magic shall sever       Thy music from thee.     Thou hast bound many eyes       In a dreamy sleep--     But the strains still arise       Which _thy_ vigilance keep--     The sound of the rain,       Which leaps down to the flower--     And dances again       In the rhythm of the shower--     The murmur that springs       From the growing of grass     Are the music of things--       But are modell'd, alas!--     Away, then, my dearest,       Oh! hie thee away     To the springs that lie clearest       Beneath the moon-ray--     To lone lake that smiles,       In its dream of deep rest,     At the many star-isles       That enjewel its breast--     Where wild flowers, creeping,       Have mingled their shade,     On its margin is sleeping       Full many a maid--     Some have left the cool glade, and       Have slept with the bee--     Arouse them, my maiden,       On moorland and lea--     Go! breathe on their slumber,       All softly in ear,     Thy musical number       They slumbered to hear--     For what can awaken       An angel so soon,     Whose sleep hath been taken       Beneath the cold moon,     As the spell which no slumber       Of witchery may test,     The rhythmical number       Which lull'd him to rest?\"  Spirits in wing, and angels to the view, A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro' Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-- Seraphs in all but \"Knowledge,\" the keen light That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar, O Death! from eye of God upon that star: Sweet was that error--sweeter still that death-- Sweet was that error--even with _us_ the breath Of Science dims the mirror of our joy-- To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy-- For what (to them) availeth it to know That Truth is Falsehood--or that Bliss is Woe? Sweet was their death--with them to die was rife With the last ecstasy of satiate life-- Beyond that death no immortality-- But sleep that pondereth and is not \"to be\"-- And there!--oh! may my weary spirit dwell-- Apart from Heaven's Eternity--and yet how far from Hell! What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts To those who hear not for their beating hearts. A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-- O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known? Unguided Love hath fallen--'mid \"tears of perfect moan.\"  He was a goodly spirit--he who fell: A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well-- A gazer on the lights that shine above-- A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: What wonder? for each star is eye-like there, And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair-- And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy To his love-haunted heart and melancholy. The night had found (to him a night of woe) Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo-- Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky, And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it Here sat he with his love--his dark eye bent With eagle gaze along the firmament: Now turn'd it upon her--but ever then It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.  \"Ianthe, dearest, see--how dim that ray! How lovely 'tis to look so far away! She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve I left her gorgeous halls--nor mourn'd to leave. That eve--that eve--I should remember well-- The sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall-- And on my eyelids--O the heavy light! How drowsily it weigh'd them into night! On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan: But O that light!--I slumber'd--Death, the while, Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle So softly that no single silken hair Awoke that slept--or knew that he was there.  \"The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon Was a proud temple called the Parthenon; More beauty clung around her column'd wall Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal, And when old Time my wing did disenthral Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower, And years I left behind me in an hour. What time upon her airy bounds I hung, One half the garden of her globe was flung Unrolling as a chart unto my view-- Tenantless cities of the desert too! Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, And half I wish'd to be again of men.\"  \"My Angelo! and why of them to be? A brighter dwelling place is here for thee-- And greener fields than in yon world above, And woman's loveliness--and passionate love.\"  \"But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft, Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world I left so late was into chaos hurl'd-- Sprang from her station, on the winds apart, And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart. Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar And fell--not swiftly as I rose before, But with a downward, tremulous motion thro' Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! Nor long the measure of my falling hours, For nearest of all stars was thine to ours-- Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.\"  \"We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us Be given our lady's bidding to discuss: We came, my love; around, above, below, Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod _She_ grants to us, as granted by her God-- But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd Never his fairy wing o'er fairier world! Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes Alone could see the phantom in the skies, When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea-- But when its glory swell'd upon the sky, As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye, We paused before the heritage of men, And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!\"  Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away The night that waned and waned and brought no day. They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.       _TO F----S S. O----D_  [Mrs. Frances Sargent Osgood]   Thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart   From its present pathway part not! Being everything which now thou art,   Be nothing which thou art not. So with the world thy gentle ways,   Thy grace, thy more than beauty, Shall be an endless theme of praise,   And love--a simple duty.       _BRIDAL BALLAD_   The ring is on my hand.   And the wreath is on my brow; Satin and jewels grand Are all at my command,   And I am happy now.  And my lord he loves me well;   But, when first he breathed his vow, I felt my bosom swell-- For the words rang as a knell, And the voice seemed _his_ who fell In the battle down the dell,   And who is happy now.  But he spoke to re-assure me,   And he kissed my pallid brow, While a reverie came o'er me, And to the church-yard bore me, And I sighed to him before me, Thinking him dead D'Elormie,   \"Oh, I am happy now!\"  And thus the words were spoken,   And this the plighted vow, And, though my faith be broken, And, though my heart be broken, Here is a ring, as token   That I am happy now!  Would God I could awaken!   For I dream I know not how! And my soul is sorely shaken Lest an evil step be taken,-- Lest the dead who is forsaken   May not be happy now.  [Illustration: Bridal Ballad]       _TO MY MOTHER_  [His Mother-in-law, Mrs. Clemm.]   Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,   The angels, whispering to one another, Can find, among their burning terms of love,   None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\" Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--   You who are more than mother unto me, And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you   In setting my Virginia's spirit free. My mother--my own mother, who died early,   Was but the mother of myself; but you Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,   And thus are dearer than the mother I knew By that infinity with which my wife   Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.       TO HELEN  [\"Helen\" was Mrs. Stannard, whose death also inspired Lenore.]   Helen, thy beauty is to me   Like those Nicean barks of yore, That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,   The weary, wayworn wanderer bore   To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,   Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home   To the glory that was Greece,   And the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche   How statue-like I see thee stand, The agate lamp within thy hand!   Ah, Psyche, from the regions which   Are Holy Land!  [Illustration: To Helen]       _THE VALLEY OF UNREST_   _Once_ it smiled a silent dell Where the people did not dwell; They had gone unto the wars, Trusting to the mild-eyed stars, Nightly, from their azure towers, To keep watch above the flowers, In the midst of which all day The red sunlight lazily lay. _Now_ each visitor shall confess The sad valley's restlessness. Nothing there is motionless-- Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude. Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas Around the misty Hebrides! Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily, from morn till even, Over the violets there that lie In myriad types of the human eye-- Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave! They wave:--from out their fragrant tops Eternal dews come down in drops. They weep:--from off their delicate stems Perennial tears descend in gems.  [Illustration: The Valley of Unrest]       _THE LAKE--TO----_   In spring of youth it was my lot To haunt of the wide world a spot The which I could not love the less-- So lovely was the loneliness Of a wild lake, with black rock bound, And the tall pines that towered around.  But when the Night had thrown her pall Upon that spot, as upon all, And the mystic wind went by Murmuring in melody-- Then--ah then I would awake To the terror of the lone lake Yet that terror was not fright, But a tremulous delight-- A feeling not the jewelled mine Could teach or bribe me to define-- Nor Love--although the Love were thine.  Death was in that poisonous wave, And in its gulf a fitting grave For him who thence could solace bring To his lone imagining-- Whose solitary sole could make An Eden of that dim lake.       _THE HAPPIEST DAY, THE HAPPIEST HOUR_   The happiest day--the happiest hour   My sear'd and blighted heart hath known, The highest hope of pride and power,   I feel hath flown.  Of power! said I? yes! such I ween;   But they have vanish'd long, alas! The visions of my youth have been--   But let them pass.  And, pride, what have I now with thee?   Another brow may even inherit The venom thou hast pour'd on me--   Be still, my spirit!  The happiest day--the happiest hour   Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen, The brightest glance of pride and power,   I feel--have been:  But were that hope of pride and power   Now offer'd, with the pain Even _then_ I felt--that brightest hour   I would not live again:  For on its wing was dark alloy,   And, as it flutter'd--fell An essence--powerful to destroy   A soul that knew it well.       _CATHOLIC HYMN_   At morn--at noon--at twilight dim-- Maria! thou hast heard my hymn! In joy and woe--in good and ill-- Mother of God, be with me still! When the hours flew brightly by, And not a cloud obscured the sky, My soul, lest it should truant be, Thy grace did guide to thine and thee; Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast Darkly my Present and my Past, Let my Future radiant shine With sweet hopes of thee and thine!       _TO ---- ----_  [Mrs. Marie Louise Shew.]   Not long ago, the writer of these lines, In the mad pride of intellectuality, Maintained \"the power of words\"--denied that ever A thought arose within the human brain Beyond the utterance of the human tongue: And now, as if in mockery of that boast, Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables-- Italian tones, made only to be murmured By angels dreaming in the moonlit \"dew That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,\" Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart, Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought, Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions Than even seraph harper, Israfel, (Who has \"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,\") Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken. The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand. With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee, I cannot write--I cannot speak or think-- Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling, This standing motionless upon the golden Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams. Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista, And thrilling as I see, upon the right, Upon the left, and all the way along, Amid empurpled vapours, far away To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_.  [Illustration: To ---- ---- (Mrs. Maris Louise Shew)]       _EVENING STAR_   'Twas noontide of summer,   And mid-time of night; And stars in their orbits,   Shone pale, thro' the light Of the brighter, cold moon,   'Mid planets her slaves, Herself in the Heavens,   Her beam on the waves.     I gazed awhile     On her cold smile; Too cold--too cold for me--   There pass'd, as a shroud,   A fleecy cloud, And I turn'd away to thee,   Proud Evening Star,   In thy glory afar, And dearer thy beam shall be;   For joy to my heart   Is the proud part Thou bearest in Heaven at night,   And more I admire   Thy distant fire, Than that colder, lowly light.       _STANZAS_    How often we forget all time, when lone   Admiring Nature's universal throne;   Her woods--her wilds--her mountains--the intense   Reply of HERS to OUR intelligence!                           [BYRON, _The Island_.]                       1  In youth have I known one with whom the Earth In secret communing held--as he with it, In daylight, and in beauty from his birth: Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth A passionate light--such for his spirit was fit-- And yet that spirit knew not, in the hour Of its own fervour--what had o'er it power.                       2  Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er, But I will half believe that wild light fraught With more of sovereignty than ancient lore Hath ever told--or is it of a thought The unembodied essence, and no more That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass As dew of the night-time o'er the summer grass?                       3  Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye To the loved object--so the tear to the lid Will start, which lately slept in apathy? And yet it need not be--(that object) hid From us in life--but common--which doth lie Each hour before us--but _then_ only, bid With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken, To awake us--'Tis a symbol and a token                       4  Of what in other worlds shall be--and given In beauty by our God, to those alone Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone, That high tone of the spirit which hath striven Tho' not with Faith--with godliness--whose throne With desperate energy 't hath beaten down; Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.    _SPIRITS OF THE DEAD_   Thy soul shall find itself alone 'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tomb-stone; Not one, of all the crowd, to pry Into thine hour of secrecy.  Be silent in that solitude,   Which is not loneliness--for then The spirits of the dead, who stood   In life before thee, are again In death around thee, and their will Shall overshadow thee; be still.  The night, though clear, shall frown, And the stars shall not look down From their high thrones in the Heaven With light like hope to mortals given, But their red orbs, without beam, To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee for ever.  Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, Now are visions ne'er to vanish; From thy spirit shall they pass No more, like dew-drop from the grass. The breeze, the breath of God, is still, And the mist upon the hill Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken, Is a symbol and a token. How it hangs upon the trees, A mystery of mysteries!       _ISRAFEL_    And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and   who has the sweetest voice of all God's creatures.--_Koran._   In Heaven a spirit doth dwell   \"Whose heart-strings are a lute;\" None sing so wildly well As the angel Israfel, And the giddy Stars (so legends tell) Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell   Of his voice, all mute.  Tottering above   In her highest noon,   The enamoured moon Blushes with love,   While, to listen, the red levin   (With the rapid Pleiads, even,   Which were seven,)   Pauses in Heaven.  And they say (the starry choir   And the other listening things) That Israfeli's fire Is owing to that lyre   By which he sits and sings-- The trembling living wire   Of those unusual strings.  But the skies that angel trod,   Where deep thoughts are a duty-- Where Love's a grown up God--   Where the Houri glances are Imbued with all the beauty   Which we worship in a star.  Therefore thou art not wrong,   Israfeli, who despisest An unimpassioned song; To thee the laurels belong,   Best bard, because the wisest! Merrily live, and long!  [Illustration: Israfel]  The ecstasies above   With thy burning measures suit-- Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,   With the fervour of thy lute--   Well may the stars be mute!  Yes, Heaven is thine; but this   Is a world of sweets and sours;   Our flowers are merely--flowers, And the shadow of thy perfect bliss   Is the sunshine of ours.  If I could dwell Where Israfel   Hath dwelt, and he where I, He might not sing so wildly well   A mortal melody, While a bolder note than this might swell   From my lyre within the sky.       _SONG_   I saw thee on thy bridal day--   When a burning blush came o'er thee, Though happiness around thee lay,   The world all love before thee:  And in thine eye a kindling light   (Whatever it might be) Was all on Earth my aching sight   Of Loveliness could see.  That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--   As such it well may pass-- Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame   In the breast of him, alas!  Who saw thee on that bridal day,   When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee, Though happiness around thee lay;   The world all love before thee.       _TO ----_   The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see   The wantonest singing birds, Are lips--and all thy melody   Of lip-begotten words--  Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined,   Then desolately fall, O God! on my funereal mind   Like starlight on a pall--  Thy heart--_thy_ heart!--I wake and sigh,   And sleep to dream till day Of the truth that gold can never buy--   Of the baubles that it may.       _FAIRY-LAND_   Dim vales--and shadowy floods-- And cloudy-looking woods, Whose forms we can't discover For the tears that drip all over Huge moons there wax and wane-- Again--again--again-- Every moment of the night-- Forever changing places-- And they put out the star-light With the breath from their pale faces. About twelve by the moon-dial, One more filmy than the rest (A kind which, upon trial, They have found to be the best) Comes down--still down--and down, With its centre on the crown Of a mountain's eminence, While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets, over halls, Wherever they may be-- O'er the strange woods--o'er the sea-- Over spirits on the wing-- Over every drowsy thing-- And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light-- And then, how deep!--O, deep! Is the passion of their sleep. In the morning they arise, And their moony covering Is soaring in the skies, With the tempests as they toss, Like-almost anything-- Or a yellow Albatross. They use that moon no more For the same end as before-- Videlicet a tent-- Which I think extravagant: Its atomies, however, Into a shower dissever, Of which those butterflies, Of Earth, who seek the skies, And so come down again (Never-contented things!) Have brought a specimen Upon their quivering wings.  [Illustration: Fairy-land]       _THE COLISEUM_   Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary Of lofty contemplation left to Time By buried centuries of pomp and power! At length--at length--after so many days Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst, (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,) I kneel, an altered and an humble man, Amid thy shadows, and so drink within My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!  Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld! Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night! I feel ye now--I feel ye in your strength-- O spells more sure than e'er Judaean king Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane! O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!  Here, where a hero fell, a column falls! Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat! Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle! Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled, Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home, Lit by the wan light of the horned moon, The swift and silent lizard of the stones!  But stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades-- These mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts-- These vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze-- These shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin-- These stones--alas! these grey stones--are they all-- All of the famed, and the colossal left By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?  \"Not all\"--the Echoes answer me--\"not all! Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise, As melody from Memnon to the Sun. We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule With a despotic sway all giant minds. We are not impotent--we pallid stones. Not all the power is gone--not all our fame-- Not all the magic of our high renown-- Not all the wonder that encircles us-- Not all the mysteries that in us lie-- Not all the memories that hang upon And cling around about us as a garment, Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.\"       _DREAMLAND_       By a route obscure and lonely,     Haunted by ill angels only,     Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,     On a black throne reigns upright,     I have reached these lands but newly     From an ultimate dim Thule-- From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,           Out of SPACE--out of TIME.      Bottomless vales and boundless floods,     And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,     With forms that no man can discover     For the tears that drip all over;     Mountains toppling evermore     Into seas without a shore;     Seas that restlessly aspire,     Surging, unto skies of fire;     Lakes that endlessly outspread     Their lone waters--lone and dead,--     Their still waters--still and chilly     With the snows of the lolling lily.      By the lakes that thus outspread     Their lone waters, lone and dead,--     Their sad waters, sad and chilly     With the snows of the lolling lily--     By the mountains--near the river     Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--     By the grey woods,--by the swamp     Where the toad and the newt encamp,--     By the dismal tarns and pools           Where dwell the Ghouls,--     By each spot the most unholy--     In each nook most melancholy,--     There the traveller meets aghast     Sheeted Memories of the Past--     Shrouded forms that start and sigh     As they pass the wanderer by--     White-robed forms of friends long given,     In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.      For the heart whose woes are legion     'Tis a peaceful, soothing region--     For the spirit that walks in shadow     'Tis--oh, 'tis an Eldorado!     But the traveller, travelling through it,     May not--dare not openly view it!     Never its mysteries are exposed     To the weak human eye unclosed;     So wills its King, who hath forbid     The uplifting of the fringèd lid;     And thus the sad Soul that here passes     Beholds it but through darkened glasses.      By a route obscure and lonely,     Haunted by ill angels only,     Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,     On a black throne reigns upright,     I have wandered home but newly     From this ultimate dim Thule.       _FOR ANNIE_   Thank Heaven! the crisis--   The danger is past, And the lingering illness   Is over at last-- And the fever called \"Living\"   Is conquered at last.  Sadly, I know   I am shorn of my strength, And no muscle I move   As I lie at full length-- But no matter!--I feel   I am better at length.  And I rest so composedly,   Now, in my bed, That any beholder   Might fancy me dead-- Might start at beholding me,   Thinking me dead.  The moaning and groaning,   The sighing and sobbing, Are quieted now,   With that horrible throbbing At heart:--ah, that horrible,   Horrible throbbing!  The sickness--the nausea--   The pitiless pain-- Have ceased, with the fever   That maddened my brain-- With the fever called \"Living\"   That burned in my brain.  And oh! of all torture   _That_ torture the worst Has abated--the terrible   Torture of thirst For the naphthaline river   Of Passion accurst:-- I have drunk of a water   That quenches all thirst:--  Of a water that flows,   With a lullaby sound, From a spring but a very few   Feet under ground-- From a cavern not very far   Down under ground.  And ah! let it never   Be foolishly said That my room it is gloomy   And narrow my bed; For man never slept   In a different bed-- And, _to sleep_, you must slumber   In just such a bed.  My tantalized spirit   Here blandly reposes. Forgetting, or never   Regretting its roses-- Its old agitations   Of myrtles and roses;  For now, while so quietly   Lying, it fancies A holier odour   About it, of pansies-- A rosemary odour,   Commingled with pansies-- With rue and the beautiful   Puritan pansies.  And so it lies happily,   Bathing in many A dream of the truth   And the beauty of Annie-- Drowned in a bath   Of the tresses of Annie.  She tenderly kissed me,   She fondly caressed, And then I fell gently   To sleep on her breast Deeply to sleep   From the heaven of her breast.  When the light was extinguished   She covered me warm, And she prayed to the angels   To keep me from harm-- To the queen of the angels   To shield me from harm.  And I lie so composedly,   Now, in my bed, (Knowing her love)   That you fancy me dead-- And I rest so contentedly,   Now, in my bed, (With her love at my breast)   That you fancy me dead-- That you shudder to look at me,   Thinking me dead;--  But my heart it is brighter   Than all of the many Stars in the sky,   For it sparkles with Annie-- It glows with the light   Of the love of my Annie-- With the thought of the light   Of the eyes of my Annie.       _ALONE_   From childhood's hour I have not been As others were; I have not seen As others saw; I could not bring My passions from a common spring. From the same source I have not taken My sorrow; I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone; And all I loved _I_ loved alone. Then--in my childhood, in the dawn Of a most stormy life--was drawn From every depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still: From the torrent, or the fountain, From the red cliff of the mountain, From the sun that round me rolled In its autumn tint of gold, From the lightning in the sky As it passed me flying by, From the thunder and the storm, And the cloud that took the form (When the rest of Heaven was blue) Of a demon in my view.  [Illustration: Alone]       TAMERLANE   Kind solace in a dying hour!   Such, father, is not (now) my theme-- I will not madly deem that power     Of Earth may shrive me of the sin     Unearthly pride hath revell'd in-- I have no time to dote or dream: You call it hope--that fire of fire! It is but agony of desire: If I _can_ hope--O God! I can--   Its fount is holier--more divine-- I would not call thee fool, old man,   But such is not a gift of thine.  Know thou the secret of a spirit   Bow'd from its wild pride into shame. O yearning heart! I did inherit   Thy withering portion with the fame, The searing glory which hath shone Amid the jewels of my throne, Halo of Hell! and with a pain Not Hell shall make me fear again-- O craving heart, for the lost flowers And sunshine of my summer hours! The undying voice of that dead time, With its interminable chime, Rings, in the spirit of a spell, Upon thy emptiness--a knell.  [Illustration: Tamerlane]  I have not always been as now: The fever'd diadem on my brow   I claim'd and won usurpingly-- Hath not the same fierce heirdom given   Rome to the Cæsar--this to me?     The heritage of a kingly mind, And a proud spirit which hath striven     Triumphantly with human kind.  On mountain soil I first drew life:   The mists of the Taglay have shed   Nightly their dews upon my head, And, I believe, the wingèd strife And tumult of the headlong air Have nestled in my very hair.  So late from Heaven--that dew--it fell   ('Mid dreams of an unholy night) Upon me with the touch of Hell,   While the red flashing of the light From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,   Appeared to my half-closing eye   The pageantry of monarchy, And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar   Came hurriedly upon me, telling     Of human battle, where my voice, My own voice, silly child!--was swelling     (O! how my spirit would rejoice, And leap within me at the cry) The battle-cry of Victory! The rain came down upon my head   Unshelter'd--and the heavy wind   Rendered me mad and deaf and blind. It was but man, I thought, who shed   Laurels upon me: and the rush-- The torrent of the chilly air   Gurgled within my ear the crush Of empires--with the captive's prayer-- The hum of suitors--and the tone Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.  My passions, from that hapless hour,   Usurp'd a tyranny which men Have deem'd since I have reach'd to power,     My innate nature--be it so:   But father, there liv'd one who, then, Then--in my boyhood--when their fire   Burn'd with a still intenser glow, (For passion must, with youth, expire)   E'en _then_ who knew this iron heart   In woman's weakness had a part.  I have no words--alas!--to tell The loveliness of loving well! Nor would I now attempt to trace The more than beauty of a face Whose lineaments, upon my mind, Are----shadows on th' unstable wind Thus I remember having dwelt   Some page of early lore upon, With loitering eye, till I have felt The letters--with their meaning--melt   To fantasies--with none.  O, she was worthy of all love!   Love--as in infancy was mine-- 'Twas such as angel minds above   Might envy; her young heart the shrine On which my every hope and thought   Were incense--then a goodly gift,     For they were childish and upright-- Pure--as her young example taught:   Why did I leave it, and, adrift,     Trust to the fire within, for light?  We grew in age--and love--together,   Roaming the forest, and the wild; My breast her shield in wintry weather--   And, when the friendly sunshine smil'd And she would mark the opening skies, _I_ saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.  Young Love's first lesson is--the heart:   For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles, When, from our little cares apart,   And laughing at her girlish wiles, I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,   And pour my spirit out in tears-- There was no need to speak the rest--   No need to quiet any fears Of her--who ask'd no reason why, But turned on me her quiet eye!  Yet _more_ than worthy of the love My spirit struggled with, and strove, When, on the mountain peak, alone, Ambition lent it a new tone-- I had no being--but in thee:   The world, and all it did contain In the earth--the air--the sea--   Its joy--its little lot of pain That was new pleasure--the ideal,   Dim vanities of dreams by night-- And dimmer nothings which were real--   (Shadows--and a more shadowy light!) Parted upon their misty wings,   And, so, confusedly, became   Thine image, and--a name--a name! Two separate--yet most intimate things.  I was ambitious--have you known   The passion, father? You have not: A cottager, I mark'd a throne Of half the world as all my own,   And murmur'd at such lowly lot-- But, just like any other dream,   Upon the vapour of the dew My own had past, did not the beam   Of beauty which did while it thro' The minute--the hour--the day--oppress My mind with double loveliness.  We walk'd together on the crown Of a high mountain which look'd down Afar from its proud natural towers   Of rock and forest, on the hills-- The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,   And shouting with a thousand rills.  I spoke to her of power and pride,   But mystically--in such guise That she might deem it nought beside   The moment's converse; in her eyes I read, perhaps too carelessly--   A mingled feeling with my own-- The flush on her bright cheek, to me   Seem'd to become a queenly throne Too well that I should let it be   Light in the wilderness alone.  [Illustration: Tamerlane]  I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,   And donn'd a visionary crown--     Yet it was not that Fantasy     Had thrown her mantle over me-- But that, among the rabble--men,   Lion ambition is chained down-- And crouches to a keeper's hand-- Not so in deserts where the grand-- The wild--the terrible conspire With their own breath to fan his fire.  Look'round thee now on Samarcand!   Is not she queen of Earth? her pride Above all cities? in her hand   Their destinies? in all beside Of glory which the world hath known Stands she not nobly and alone? Falling--her veriest stepping-stone Shall form the pedestal of a throne-- And who her sovereign? Timour--he   Whom the astonished people saw Striding o'er empires haughtily   A diadem'd outlaw!  O, human love! thou spirit given, On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven! Which fall'st into the soul like rain Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain, And, failing in thy power to bless, But leav'st the heart a wilderness! Idea! which bindest life around With music of so strange a sound, And beauty of so wild a birth-- Farewell! for I have won the Earth.  When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see   No cliff beyond him in the sky, His pinions were bent droopingly--   And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye. 'Twas sunset: when the sun will part There comes a sullenness of heart To him who still would look upon The glory of the summer sun. That soul will hate the ev'ning mist, So often lovely, and will list To the sound of the coming darkness (known To those whose spirits hearken) as one Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.  What tho' the moon--the white moon Shed all the splendour of her noon, _Her_ smile is chilly, and _her_ beam, In that time of dreariness, will seem (So like you gather in your breath) A portrait taken after death. And boyhood is a summer sun Whose waning is the dreariest one-- For all we live to know is known, And all we seek to keep hath flown-- Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall With the noon-day beauty--which is all. I reach'd my home--my home no more--   For all had flown who made it so. I pass'd from out its mossy door,   And, tho' my tread was soft and low, A voice came from the threshold stone Of one whom I had earlier known--   O, I defy thee, Hell, to show   On beds of fire that burn below,   A humbler heart--a deeper woe.  Father, I firmly do believe--   I _know_--for Death, who comes for me     From regions of the blest afar, Where there is nothing to deceive,     Hath left his iron gate ajar,   And rays of truth you cannot see   Are flashing thro' Eternity---- I do believe that Eblis hath A snare in every human path-- Else how, when in the holy grove I wandered of the idol, Love, Who daily scents his snowy wings With incense of burnt offerings From the most unpolluted things, Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven No mote may shun--no tiniest fly-- The light'ning of his eagle eye-- How was it that Ambition crept,   Unseen, amid the revels there, Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt   In the tangles of Love's very hair?

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate  Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

the reason as all men know      in this kingdom by the sea that the wind came out of the cloud by night      chilling and killing my annabel lee  but our love it was stronger by far than the love      of those who were older than we      of many far wiser than we and neither the angels in heaven above      nor the demons down under the sea can ever dissever my soul from the soul      of the beautiful annabel lee  for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams      of the beautiful annabel lee and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes      of the beautiful annabel lee and

nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door             only this and nothing more  ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore             nameless here for evermore  and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door             this it is and nothing more  presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door             darkness there and nothing more  deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering       fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore             merely this and nothing more  back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore             tis the wind and nothing more  open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door             perched and sat and nothing more  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no       craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore             quoth the raven nevermore  much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door             with such name as nevermore  but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown       before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before             then the bird said nevermore  startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore             of nevernevermore  but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and       door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore             meant in croaking nevermore  this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer             she shall press ah nevermore  then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath       sent thee respiterespite and nepenthe

forgetting or never   regretting its roses its old agitations   of myrtles and roses  for now while so quietly   lying it fancies a holier odour   about it of pansies a rosemary odour   commingled with pansies with rue and the beautiful   puritan pansies  and so it lies happily   bathing in many a dream of the truth   and the beauty of annie drowned in a bath   of the tresses of annie  she tenderly kissed me   she fondly caressed and then i fell gently   to sleep on her breast deeply to sleep   from the heaven of her breast  when the light was extinguished   she covered me warm and she prayed to the angels   to keep me from harm to the queen of the angels   to shield me from harm  and i lie so composedly   now in my bed knowing her love   that you fancy me dead and i rest so contentedly   now in my bed with her love at my breast   that you fancy me dead that you shudder to look at me   thinking me dead  but my heart it is brighter   than all of the many stars in the sky   for it sparkles with annie it glows with the light   of the love of my annie with the thought of the light   of the eyes of my annie       alone   from childhoods hour i have not been as others were i have not seen as others saw i could not bring my passions from a common spring from the same source i have not taken my sorrow i could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone and all i loved i loved alone thenin my childhood in the dawn of a most stormy lifewas drawn from every depth of good and ill the mystery which binds me still from the torrent or the fountain from the red cliff of the mountain from the sun that round me rolled in its autumn tint of gold from the lightning in the sky as it passed me flying by from the thunder and the storm and the cloud that took the form when the rest of heaven was blue of a demon in my view  illustration alone       tamerlane   kind solace in a dying hour   such father is not now my theme i will not madly deem that power     of earth may shrive me of the sin     unearthly pride hath revelld in i have no time to dote or dream you call it hopethat fire of fire it is but agony of desire if i can hopeo god i can   its fount is holiermore divine i would not call thee fool old man   but such is not a gift of thine  know thou the secret of a spirit   bowd from its wild pride into shame o yearning heart i did inherit   thy withering portion with the fame the searing glory which hath shone amid the jewels of my throne halo of hell and with a pain not hell shall make me fear again o craving heart for the lost flowers and sunshine of my summer hours the undying voice of that dead time with its interminable chime rings in the spirit of a spell upon thy emptinessa knell  illustration tamerlane  i have not always been as now the feverd diadem on my brow   i claimd and won usurpingly hath not the same fierce heirdom given   rome to the cæsarthis to me     the heritage of a kingly mind and a proud spirit which hath striven     triumphantly with human kind  on mountain soil i first drew life   the mists of the taglay have shed   nightly their dews upon my head and i believe the wingèd strife and tumult of the headlong air have nestled in my very hair  so late from heaventhat dewit fell   mid dreams of an unholy night upon me with the touch of hell   while the red flashing of the light from clouds that hung like banners oer   appeared to my halfclosing eye   the pageantry of monarchy and the deep trumpetthunders roar   came hurriedly upon me telling     of human battle where my voice my own voice silly childwas swelling     o how my spirit would rejoice and leap within me at the cry the battlecry of victory the rain came down upon my head   unshelterdand the heavy wind   rendered me mad and deaf and blind it was but man i thought who shed   laurels upon me and the rush the torrent of the chilly air   gurgled within my ear the crush of empireswith the captives prayer the hum of suitorsand the tone of flattery round a sovereigns throne  my passions from that hapless hour   usurpd a tyranny which men have deemd since i have reachd to power     my innate naturebe it so   but father there livd one who then thenin my boyhoodwhen their fire   burnd with a still intenser glow for passion must with youth expire   een then who knew this iron heart   in womans weakness had a part  i have no wordsalasto tell the loveliness of loving well nor would i now attempt to trace the more than beauty of a face whose lineaments upon my mind areshadows on th unstable wind thus i remember having dwelt   some page of early lore upon with loitering eye till i have felt the letterswith their meaningmelt   to fantasieswith none  o she was worthy of all love   loveas in infancy was mine twas such as angel minds above   might envy her young heart the shrine on which my every hope and thought   were incensethen a goodly gift     for they were childish and upright pureas her young example taught   why did i leave it and adrift     trust to the fire within for light  we grew in ageand lovetogether   roaming the forest and the wild my breast her shield in wintry weather   and when the friendly sunshine smild and she would mark the opening skies i saw no heavenbut in her eyes  young loves first lesson isthe heart   for mid that sunshine and those smiles when from our little cares apart   and laughing at her girlish wiles id throw me on her throbbing breast   and pour my spirit out in tears there was no need to speak the rest   no need to quiet any fears of herwho askd no reason why but turned on me her quiet eye  yet more than worthy of the love my spirit struggled with and strove when on the mountain peak alone ambition lent it a new tone i had no beingbut in thee   the world and all it did contain in the earththe airthe sea   its joyits little lot of pain that was new pleasurethe ideal   dim vanities of dreams by night and dimmer nothings which were real   shadowsand a more shadowy light parted upon their misty wings   and so confusedly became   thine image anda namea name two separateyet most intimate things  i was ambitioushave you known   the passion father you have not a cottager i markd a throne of half the world as all my own   and murmurd at such lowly lot but just like any other dream   upon the vapour of the dew my own had past did not the beam   of beauty which did while it thro the minutethe hourthe dayoppress my mind with double loveliness  we walkd together on the crown of a high mountain which lookd down afar from its proud natural towers   of rock and forest on the hills the dwindled hills begirt with bowers   and shouting with a thousand rills  i spoke to her of power and pride   but mysticallyin such guise that she might deem it nought beside   the moments converse in her eyes i read perhaps too carelessly   a mingled feeling with my own the flush on her bright cheek to me   seemd to become a queenly throne too well that i should let it be   light in the wilderness alone  illustration tamerlane  i wrappd myself in grandeur then   and donnd a visionary crown     yet it was not that fantasy     had thrown her mantle over me but that among the rabblemen   lion ambition is chained down and crouches to a keepers hand not so in deserts where the grand the wildthe terrible conspire with their own breath to fan his fire  lookround thee now on samarcand   is not she queen of earth her pride above all cities in her hand   their destinies in all beside of glory which the world hath known stands she not nobly and alone fallingher veriest steppingstone shall form the pedestal of a throne and who her sovereign timourhe   whom the astonished people saw striding oer empires haughtily   a diademd outlaw  o human love thou spirit given on earth of all we hope in heaven which fallst into the soul like rain upon the sirocwitherd plain and failing in thy power to bless but leavst the heart a wilderness idea which bindest life around with music of so strange a sound and beauty of so wild a birth farewell for i have won the earth  when hope the eagle that towerd could see   no cliff beyond him in the sky his pinions were bent droopingly   and homeward turnd his softend eye twas sunset when the sun will part there comes a sullenness of heart to him who still would look upon the glory of the summer sun that soul will hate the evning mist so often lovely and will list to the sound of the coming darkness known to those whose spirits hearken as one who in a dream of night would fly but cannot from a danger nigh  what tho the moonthe white moon shed all the splendour of her noon her smile is chilly and her beam in that time of dreariness will seem so like you gather in your breath a portrait taken after death and boyhood is a summer sun whose waning is the dreariest one for all we live to know is known and all we seek to keep hath flown let life then as the dayflower fall with the noonday beautywhich is all i reachd my homemy home no more   for all had flown who made it so i passd from out its mossy door   and tho my tread was soft and low a voice came from the threshold stone of one whom i had earlier known   o i defy thee hell to show   on beds of fire that burn below   a humbler hearta deeper woe  father i firmly do believe   i knowfor death who comes for me     from regions of the blest afar where there is nothing to deceive     hath left his iron gate ajar   and rays of truth you cannot see   are flashing thro eternity i do believe that eblis hath a snare in every human path else how when in the holy grove i wandered of the idol love who daily scents his snowy wings with incense of burnt offerings from the most unpolluted things whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven above with trellisd rays from heaven no mote may shunno tiniest fly the lightning of his eagle eye how was it that ambition crept   unseen amid the revels there till growing bold he laughed and leapt   in the tangles of loves very
